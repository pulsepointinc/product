You can target such a list as follows:\nTarget the HCPs themselves via (e.g.) the\nNPI Targeting Type\n.\nThis data is sourced from entities such as Rxs filled at pharmacies, or claims (for medical procedures) filed with insurance companies.\nYou can also\nreport on\nthese Smart Lists.\nYou can track the following:\nPrescribed Drug (Rx)\nDiagnosis (Dx)\nMedical Procedure (Tx)\nPrescription Behavior Change\nThis Smart List will dynamically add/remove NPIs for targeted HCPs, according to the abovementioned clinical prescribing and medical cla\nim behavior.\nPRO TIP (Except for Prescription Behavior Change)\nYou can use these lists in conjunction with one another\n(and with other types of lists)\nper the following examples:\nYou can include HCPs who diagnose obesity, but exclude HCPs who already prescribe your drug. That way, you will reach only HCPs to whom you wish to promote your drug.\nYou can include HCPs who perform colonoscopies, but exclude any who already prescribe your drug.\nYou can include HCPs who perform colonoscopies,\nbut exclude HCPs who specialize in Family Medicine (via the\nSpecialty\noption)\n.\nREMINDER\nYou cannot view the specific NPIs belonging to a Smart List.\nNOTE\nIf you include more than one drug, the NPI will be added to the Smart List if the HCP prescribed\nany specified drug\n. The same concept holds for diagnoses and medical procedures.\nIf you enable more than one list population option (\nPrescribed Drug, Diagnosis, Medical Procedure, Prescription Behavior Change\n), we will add the NPI\nonly\nif the criteria are met across\nall\nsuch list population options.\nExample\n: If you select DRUG A and DRUG B, and DIAGNOSIS C and DIAGNOSIS D, we will add the NPI if\nboth\nof the following apply:\nThe HCP has prescribed DRUG A\nor\nDRUG B.\nThe HCP has prescribed a drug that applies to DIAGNOSIS C\nor\nDIAGNOSIS D.\nPreparation:\nIf you have not yet assigned a name to this Smart List:\nEnter list name.

It consists of three segments (e.g.,\n0123-0004-05\n,\n12345-6789-12\n). We use only the first two segments.\nExamples:\n0123-0004\n12345-6789\nYou can use this option, for example, to target doctors prescribing competitor drug(s) in order to promote your drug.\nPRO TIP (Bulk Upload)\nYou can use\nBulk Upload\nto specify a large number of such drugs.\nCheck checkbox.

      "content": "Required Omnichannel Audiences Criteria\nUser specific criteria:\nOmnichannel Audiences: Pushing PulsePoint-curated HCP audiences to Meta is a self-service/self-service+ only offering.\nOmnichannel Audiences Billing, Legal, and Setup-Specific Criteria:\nIf clients are new to using Omnichannel Audiences (Meta), they need to sign a\nlegal addendum\n; It is a requirement to sign a legal addendum to grant PulsePoint permission to push audience data (e.g. audience attributes like demographics) into a Meta account (Facebook/Instagram).\nAddendum -\nUsers are required to send PulsePoint reporting at the end of every month showing daily campaign-to-date data, used for billing. This only needs to be signed once at the advertiser level.\nClients also need to sign and accept the Terms of Service on Facebook for using third party audiences such as PulsePoint Omnichannel Audiences. To sign the Advertiser Terms of Service, you need to accept them within the Facebook Ads Manager or Business Suite.\nUsers must also grant PulsePoint access to each brand’s Meta accounts for linking, following\nthese instructions\n.\nTo enable Physician-Level Data (PLD) reporting for Omnichannel Audiences (Meta), clients require two things:\nClients must work with the PulsePoint team prior to campaign deployment to place all necessary\nSmart Pixels\non all relevant ads and sites. If Smart Pixels are already in place on your ads/site, you do not need to retag the Smart Pixels.\nAdditional Custom\nUTM parameters\nmust be applied to all applicable social ads and landing pages. Clients must request setup from their PulsePoint representative so they can implement it for you prior to campaign launch.\nUpon onboarding, an intake of specific account users that need access to Omnichannel Audiences & NPI List Management is required. User access is for the two current parts of Omnichannel Audiences:\nAudience page\nAccess to PLD (assuming requirements above are met)\nFAQ\nGeneral\nQ: What are Omnichannel Audiences?\nA:\nOmnichannel Audiences tap into PulsePoint’s industry-leading HCP identity graph and proprietary DirectMatch™ technology to create highly customized, verified HCP target lists. These authenticated HCP target lists enable precise media activation across integrated social platforms, including Meta (Facebook and Instagram).\nNOTE: Users can build HCP audiences within PulsePoint’s platform, and PulsePoint pushes the audiences directly into that user’s defined Meta account manager via API. Users are responsible for running social campaigns themselves, directly on Meta’s Campaign Manager, leveraging PulsePoint-curated HCP target lists.\nQ: Can Omnichannel Audiences support DTC and HCP?\nA\n: HCP Only: Omnichannel Audiences (Meta - Facebook/Instagram) is available for HCP campaigns only\nQ: How do you create and launch an Omnichannel Audience?\nA\n: The following steps must be followed for Omnichannel Audiences to be pushed successfully:\nClients must complete all necessary steps in the Omnichannel Audiences setup requirements process as listed within the\nBilling, Legal, and Setup section\non the first page of this FAQ, and must notify PulsePoint if PLD reporting is desired so the required setup steps outlined within the Billing, Legal, and Setup section can be completed.\nUpon onboarding, an intake of specific account users that need access to Omnichannel Audiences is required. User access is for the two current parts of the Omnichannel Audiences:\nAudience page\nAccess to PLD (assuming requirements above are met)\nUsers must also permit PulsePoint to access their Meta accounts for audience sharing purposes. To link accounts, PulsePoint Account Managers must create a Product Ops Jira ticket requesting linking. This process can take up to 24 hours.\nOnce completed, HCP audiences can then be created directly within PulsePoint’s platform following\nthese instructions\n. HCP audiences can be created using four methods:\nBrand-provided static NPI lists\nCustom NPI lists created by PulsePoint on behalf of the brand (using all available HCP targeting rules)\nAny NPI Smart List\nTM\ntype\nProfession or Specialty NPI lists\nOnce HCP target lists are finalized, users can push the list to their Meta ad account following\ninstructions here\n, and within a week, all verified and qualified HCPs will be matched to their social media accounts, and the HCP target lists will be transferred to a brand’s social Business Manager account by PulsePoint.\nFrom there, users are responsible for associating each HCP target list with the intended campaign for targeting purposes.\nQ: Where can I access step-by-step instructions for how to build an HCP target list and send it to Meta?\nA\n: Please follow instructions\nhere\nin PulsePoint Knowledge Base for users.\nQ: What is the recommended audience size of the HCP target list to be uploaded to Meta?\nA:\nMeta requires a minimum of 1,000 matched audience size for a segment to be eligible for activation. If your HCP matched audience is too small or results in a low match rate, Meta may not allow the audience to be used. PulsePoint cannot guarantee successful audience creation due to restrictions from Meta on audience sizes when the matched NPI audience from PulsePoint is below 5,000. While we have successfully uploaded lists under 2,000 NPIs, performance can vary depending on list quality and NPI coverage.\nIf you have multiple smaller lists, we recommend combining them into a single segment within the PulsePoint platform before upload to improve match success. While there is no fixed minimum input size, uploading lists with at least 5,000–10,000 matched NPIs is considered best practice for scalability and success.\nIf your audience fails to activate in Meta, please contact your PulsePoint representative. We can assist with optimization or recommend additional audience strategies like Smart Lists, or provide additional support, but we cannot guarantee all segments pushed to Meta will be eligible for activation.\nQ: How long does it take Meta’s Campaign Manager to match PulsePoint audiences?\nA:\nUsers may see a shell of a PulsePoint-curated audience in their social Campaign Manager within 24-72 hours after the audience list is sent to the social platform. However, Meta’s Campaign Manager can take at least 3-5 days for a PulsePoint audience to fully populate in its platform before deploying it to an active campaign.\nQ: What happens if I toggle off an audience within the Omnichannel Audiences platform?\nA:\nWhen you toggle off an audience within our Omnichannel Audiences platform, your social campaigns on Meta continue to run, but they will stop doing any audience refreshes until you toggle on again.\nQ: What happens if HCPs are removed from a PulsePoint-generated Meta audience post-deployment?\nA\n: If HCPs are removed from an Omnichannel Audience target list within PulsePoint’s platform, the target list in Meta’s platforms will remove those HCPs from their target list as well, within 24 hours.\nQ: Why does Facebook show an A and a B segment after the audience starts populating? Which one should the client use?\nA\n: When audiences are pushed over, Facebook automatically creates a B segment that is web sourced.\nIt is recommended to only run the A audience.\nQ: Can we create an NPI list of CTV viewers for Smart Pixel and then retarget them on Social?\nA: Yes we can.\nReporting\nQ: Is Physician-Level Data (PLD) reporting available for Omnichannel Audiences?\nA\n: If you would like to receive Physician-Level Data (PLD) Omnichannel Audience reporting and dashboard access from PulsePoint, you must work with PulsePoint to properly tag ads and sites according to our\nSmart Pixel implementation guide\n, and\nadd custom UTM parameters\nbefore the social campaign is launched, or opt into PulsePoint’s HCP365 analytics and onboarding requirements. Once you are set up to access PLD reporting, you can download ad hoc reports at any time via the download button in the PLD reporting and dashboard UI.\nNOTE: Omnichannel Audience reporting will not be available within PulsePoint’s standard Report Builder. Custom reports, scheduled reports, or SFTP connections are not available at this time. We are actively working to develop reporting scheduling and customization features, and an ETA will be shared once those are ready. Currently, we will not support any new requests for manually building custom reporting.\nQ: What data dimensions does Physician-Level Data (PLD) reporting support for Omnichannel Audiences?\nAdhering to PLD reporting setup instructions outlined above will ensure clients receive the most accurate data retrieval, and include visibility to granular HCP insights reported with that pixel, including the following dimensions, updated to reflect the latest data provided to PulsePoint from Meta’s campaign manager:\nNPI NUMBER\nDAY\nTIME STAMP\nDEVICE TYPE\nOS\nCAMPAIGN ID\nCAMPAIGN NAME\nADSET ID\nADSET NAME\nPRIMARY SPECIALTY\nPROFESSION\nHOSPITAL AFFILIATION\nPRACTICE AFFILIATION\nMEDICAL SCHOOL\nAGE\nGENDER\nAD ID\nAD NAME\nUTM CAMPAIGN\nUTM MEDIUM\nUTM SOURCE\nUTM TERM\nUTM CONTENT\nREPORTING SOURCE\nPAGE URL\nQ: Is PLD reporting available at the impression level?\nImpression reporting is not available in PulsePoint’s platform since ad impressions are tracked within external platforms (e.g., Meta) where activation is taking place. Users can get campaign impression data directly within those platforms on a daily basis. We are actively building dashboard reporting capabilities to display impressions, clicks, and data costs. An ETA will be shared once those are ready.\nQ: How does Omnichannel Audiences respect varying levels of PII sensitivity in its reporting for programmatic vs social campaigns?\nA:\nProgrammatic and social campaign reporting are separately provisioned. Depending on the client’s request, we can provision access at the user level or account level for programmatic and social campaign reporting separately.\nHowever, if you are not permissioned to see NPI level details with PII information, then you cannot access the self-serve version of PLD reporting in the Omnichannel Audiences platform. You can go through your sales rep and Account Manager to obtain reporting that blinds NPI-level details. We are actively working on the capability to blind / unblind NPI-level details in PLD reporting so all users can access the self-serve version of PLD reporting, and an ETA will be shared once it is ready.\nQ: What if PulsePoint PLD reporting data does not match results from external platform reporting?\nA:\nPulsePoint’s PLD reporting captures verified HCP activity only after a user lands on a brand’s website, assuming proper Custom UTM tagging and pixel implementation instructions are followed. It measures HCPs exposed on-site, not impressions or ad clicks tracked by external platforms (e.g., Meta), and therefore should not be directly compared to those metrics.\nInstead, PLD reporting provides a deeper view of HCP attributes for those that have landed on a brand’s site after exposure to a campaign run on an external platform (e.g., Meta).\nQ: Why do the PLD widget totals sometimes differ within the Omnichannel reporting dashboard?\nA:\nSome differences in totals across the PLD dashboard may occur because we do not always have complete data for every HCP. For example, a provider might appear in overall counts but be excluded from certain views if specific details—like age or gender—are missing.\nMatch rates\nQ: Are match rates available for matching an HCP in PulsePoint to their Meta accounts pre-activation?\nA\n: Omnichannel Audience match rates and the estimated audience size targeted via each external platform (e.g., Meta) will vary depending on the HCP target lists used, the targeting methodology used by the platform, and the number of account users targeted on each platform.\nMeta provides an Estimated Audience Size based on their methodology to size an audience that PulsePoint sends them. In many cases, it is more than the target list count. This is due to factors like automatic audience expansion (e.g., Advantage+ or Detailed Targeting Expansion), modeling based on partial matches, inclusion of users across Facebook, Instagram, and Audience Network, as well as estimation methods that account for potential reach rather than exact list size. These estimates often reflect broader targeting and delivery assumptions rather than a strict match to your original audience.\nOn top of that, Meta’s Estimated Audience Size generally estimates how many Accounts Center accounts meet the targeting and ad placement criteria that advertisers select while creating an ad. An Accounts Center account refers to either (1) an individual Facebook or Instagram account that has not been added to the same Accounts Center as another account, (2) the two or more Facebook and Instagram accounts that have been added to the same Accounts Center. For users that have unlinked their Facebook and Instagram accounts, these may be double counted as separate users.\nForecasting\nQ: How can a user forecast for Omnichannel Audiences?\nA\n: Since the actual campaign is set up and run by the client within their own social media Business Manager account, clients can use their social media platform’s forecasting tool to predict impressions, clicks, etc.\nActivation / Contact\nQ: How can a user request access to Omnichannel Audiences?\nA\n: Please inform your dedicated Sales Rep and Account Manager. Also, please submit the mandatory\nlegal Omnichannel Audiences addendum\n. Your AM will go through intake questions with you, which are used to set up the appropriate user access to Omnichannel Audiences (Meta).",

      "content": "Required Omnichannel Audiences Criteria\nNOTE\nLinkedIn Omnichannel audiences are currently in BETA and may be subject to change.\nUser specific criteria:\nOmnichannel Audiences: Pushing PulsePoint-curated HCP audiences to LinkedIn is a self-service/self-service+ only offering.\nOmnichannel Audiences Billing, Legal, and Setup specific criteria:\nIf clients are new to using Omnichannel Audiences (LinkedIn), they need to work with their dedicated Account Manager and sales representative to sign a legal addendum to grant PulsePoint permission to push audience data (e.g., audience attributes like demographics) into a LinkedIn account.\nUsers must also grant PulsePoint access to each brand’s LinkedIn accounts for linking:\nAccess to LinkedIn through PulsePoint is facilitated via users’ personal LinkedIn accounts. When a user logs into the PulsePoint Omnichannel interface, they authenticate using their own LinkedIn credentials. The permissions associated with that LinkedIn user dictate which ad accounts they can view and interact with within the PulsePoint platform.\nThe only requirement for LinkedIn activation in PulsePoint is that the user must have the appropriate ad account access through their personal LinkedIn login. There is no need for PulsePoint to be added as a Business Manager partner. Both agency and in-house users can authenticate and push audiences as long as they have the correct permissions. If access to a particular ad account is missing, the issue must be resolved within LinkedIn Business Manager by updating the user’s account-level permissions.\nAfter the correct permissions are configured, work with your PulsePoint Account Manager to hide/display the relevant LinkedIn account(s) to push audiences to under the desired PulsePoint Account and Advertiser.\nTo enable Physician-Level Data (PLD) reporting for Omnichannel Audiences (LinkedIn), clients require two things:\nClients must work with the PulsePoint team prior to campaign deployment to place all necessary Smart Pixels on all relevant ads and sites. If Smart Pixels are already in place on your ads/site, you do not need to retag the Smart Pixels.\nAdditional Custom\nUTM parameters\nmust be applied to all applicable social ads and landing pages. Clients must request setup from their PulsePoint representative so they can implement it for you prior to campaign launch.\nUpon onboarding, an intake of specific account users that need access to Omnichannel Audiences & NPI List Management is required. User access is for the two current parts of Omnichannel Audiences:\nAudience Page\nAccess to PLD (assuming requirements above are met)\nFAQ\nGeneral\nQ: What are Omnichannel Audiences?\nA:\nOmnichannel Audiences tap into PulsePoint’s industry-leading HCP identity graph and proprietary DirectMatch™ technology to create highly customized, verified HCP target lists. These authenticated HCP target lists enable precise media activation across integrated social platforms, including LinkedIn.\nNOTE: Users can build HCP audiences within PulsePoint’s platform, and PulsePoint pushes the audiences directly into that user’s defined LinkedIn campaign manager via API. Users are responsible for running social campaigns themselves, directly on LinkedIn’s Campaign Manager, leveraging PulsePoint-curated HCP target lists.\nQ: Can Omnichannel Audiences support DTC and HCP?\nA\n: HCP Only: Omnichannel Audiences (LinkedIn) is available for HCP campaigns only.\nQ: How do you connect your LinkedIn business accounts to PulsePoint?\nA\n: The following steps must be followed for Omnichannel Audiences to be pushed successfully:\nClient Requirements to Participate:\nClients must complete all necessary steps in the Omnichannel Audiences setup requirements process as listed within the Billing, Legal, and Setup section on the first page of this FAQ, and must notify PulsePoint if PLD reporting is desired, so that the required setup steps outlined within the\nBilling, Legal, and Setup\nsection can be completed.\nImplementation:\nClient signs into their LinkedIn account via the channel page.\nProvide the proper access when activating campaigns through PulsePoint’s Omnichannel Activation platform. Below are the types of access you would need to set up, depending on the type of users your organization works with.\nPersonal LinkedIn Accounts as Access Points:\nWithin Omnichannel Audiences, users can login with a LinkedIn account which is associated with the relevant LinkedIn Ad Account.\nAccess to ad accounts within PulsePoint is based on what the LinkedIn user account has been permissioned for within LinkedIn.\nNo additional setup is required beyond the user logging in with a LinkedIn account that already has access to the desired ad accounts.\nBusiness Manager (BM) Structure:\nBusiness Manager is used by clients or agencies to centrally manage ad accounts, assign user permissions, and control billing.\nIndividual users are granted access to ad accounts through Business Manager, but BM is not directly integrated or exposed in PulsePoint.\nIf a user sees no ad accounts, it likely means their LinkedIn account does not have the necessary permissions. This issue must be resolved in Business Manager by an admin.\nAgency-Managed Access:\nMany brands work with an agency that owns and manages a LinkedIn Business Manager account.\nAgencies typically grant their team members access to multiple brand ad accounts.\nOnce an agency user with the appropriate access logs into PulsePoint, all ad accounts they have permissions for are automatically made available.\nInstructions to provide access to link PulsePoint accounts to LinkedIn accounts:\nUser Authenticates via LinkedIn:\nThe user logs into PulsePoint using the PulsePoint account that has access to the LinkedIn ad accounts of interest through the platform’s LinkedIn integration.\nPulsePoint Pulls Accessible Ad Accounts:\nUsing the authentication token from LinkedIn, PulsePoint retrieves a list of all ad accounts that the user has permission to access.\nUser Selects Ad Account:\nThe user selects the appropriate ad account from the list to push audiences to.\nAudience Delivery and Reporting:\nPulsePoint delivers audience segments into the selected ad account and retrieves delivery metrics via LinkedIn’s API.\nQ: How do you set up audiences and push them to LinkedIn?\nOnce your LinkedIn and PulsePoint accounts are connected, HCP audiences can then be created directly within PulsePoint’s platform following\nt\nhese instructions\n. HCP audiences can be created using four methods:\nBrand-provided static NPI Lists\nCustom NPI lists created by PulsePoint on behalf of the brand (using all available HCP targeting rules)\nAny NPI Smart List™ type\nProfession or Specialty NPI lists\nOnce HCP target lists are finalized, users can push the list to their LinkedIn ad account following the\ninstructions here\n, and within a week, all verified and qualified HCPs will be matched to their social media accounts, and the HCP target lists will be transferred to a brand’s social Business Manager account by PulsePoint.\nFrom there, users are responsible for associating each HCP target list with the intended campaign for targeting purposes by checking the\nLinkedIn\ncheckbox in the left-hand sidebar, then clicking toggle on for each audience. These steps will ensure that the target audience list (s) will be pushed to the intended LinkedIn campaigns.\nQ: What is the recommended audience size of the HCP target list to be uploaded to LinkedIn?\nA:\nAccording to LinkedIn, they require a minimum of\n300\nmatched audience size for a segment to be eligible for activation. If your HCP-matched audience is too small or results in a low match rate, LinkedIn may not allow the audience to be used.\nIf you have multiple smaller lists, we recommend combining them into a single segment within the PulsePoint platform before upload to improve match success. While there is no fixed minimum input size, uploading lists with at least\n5,000–10,000\nmatched NPIs is considered best practice for scalability and success.\nIf your audience fails to activate in LinkedIn, please contact your PulsePoint representative.\nQ: How long does it take LinkedIn’s Campaign Manager to match PulsePoint audiences?\nA:\nIt takes up to 48 hours for LinkedIn’s Campaign Manager to match PulsePoint audiences.\nQ: What happens if I toggle off an audience within the Omnichannel Audiences platform?\nA:\nWhen you toggle off an audience within our Omnichannel Audiences platform, your social campaigns on LinkedIn continue to run, but they will stop doing any audience refreshes until you toggle on again.\nQ: What happens if HCPs are removed from a PulsePoint-generated LinkedIn audience post-deployment?\nA\n: When HCPs are removed from a PulsePoint audience segment, we ensure those changes are reflected in the next audience sync sent to LinkedIn. On the backend, we calculate the difference between users for previous and current days. Then, we upload the difference. HCPs that were added to the segment will be added to the audience sync; HCPs that are no longer in the segment will be removed from the audience sync.\nQ: Can we create an NPI list of CTV viewers for Smart Pixel and then retarget them on Social?\nA: Yes, we can.\nReporting\nQ: Is Physician-Level Data (PLD) reporting available for Omnichannel Audiences?\nA\n: Yes, PLD reporting is available for Omnichannel Audiences, including campaigns activated on LinkedIn. To enable PLD reporting for LinkedIn campaigns, clients must tag their LinkedIn ads with\ncustom UTM parameters\nand ensure their brand website is properly tagged using PulsePoint’s Smart Pixel, as outlined in our\nimplementation guide\n.\nThis setup allows PulsePoint to track HCP website traffic driven by LinkedIn ads, enabling attribution at the NPI level. Alternatively, clients can opt into PulsePoint’s HCP365 analytics and onboarding requirements to enable more comprehensive tracking. Once configured, users with appropriate permissions can access PLD reporting via the PLD dashboard and download ad hoc reports through the UI at any time.\nNOTE: Omnichannel Audience reporting will not be available within PulsePoint’s standard Report Builder. Custom reports, scheduled reports, or SFTP connections are not available at this time. We are actively working to develop reporting scheduling and customization features, and an ETA will be shared once those are ready. Currently, we will not support any new requests for manually building custom reporting.\nQ: What data dimensions does Physician-Level Data (PLD) reporting support for Omnichannel Audiences?\nAdhering to the PLD reporting setup instructions outlined above will ensure clients receive the most accurate data retrieval, and include visibility to granular HCP insights reported with that pixel. These insights include the following dimensions, updated to reflect the latest data provided to PulsePoint from LinkedIn’s campaign manager:\nDay\nUTM Campaign\nUTM Term\nDevice Type\nGender\nTimestamp Time\nNPI\nMedical School\nCampaign Group ID\nOS\nUTM Content\nCampaign Group Name\nPrimary Specialty\nUTM Source\nCampaign ID\nAge\nUTM Medium\nCampaign Name\nAd Name\nAd ID\nQ: Is PLD reporting available at the impression level?\nImpression reporting is not available in PulsePoint’s platform since ad impressions are tracked within external platforms (e.g., LinkedIn) where activation is taking place. Users can get campaign impression data directly within those platforms on a daily basis. We are actively building dashboard reporting capabilities to display impressions, clicks, and data costs. An ETA will be shared once those are ready.\nQ: How does Omnichannel Audiences respect varying levels of PII sensitivity in its reporting?\nA:\nNational Provider Identifier (NPI) is a unique ID for every HCP in the nation. Because NPIs can be tied to identifiable individuals and their activities, they are classified as personally identifiable information (PII) under healthcare data privacy standards.\nProgrammatic and social campaign reporting are separately provisioned to access NPI. Depending on the client’s request, we can grant access at the user level or account level for each reporting type. For example, a brand can have an ad account with PulsePoint. The brand’s employees and agency can access the ad account as separate users. The brand can choose to expose NPI-level details only to employees but not the agency.\nHowever, if the account or user is permissioned to view NPI-level details, you cannot access the self-serve version of PLD reporting in the Omnichannel Audiences platform. In these cases, reporting must be requested through your sales rep and Account Manager, who can provide blinded NPI-level reporting.\nWe are actively working on the ability to blind/unblind NPI-level details in PLD reporting, with an ETA to be shared once available.\nQ: What if PulsePoint PLD reporting data does not match results from external platform reporting?\nA:\nPulsePoint’s PLD reporting captures verified HCP activity only after a user lands on a brand’s website, assuming proper Custom UTM tagging and pixel implementation instructions are followed. It measures HCPs exposed on-site, not impressions or ad clicks tracked by external platforms (e.g., LinkedIn), and therefore should not be directly compared to those metrics.\nInstead, PLD reporting provides a deeper view of HCP attributes for those that have landed on a brand’s site after exposure to a campaign that is run on an external platform (e.g., LinkedIn).\nQ: Why do the PLD widget totals sometimes differ within the Omnichannel reporting dashboard?\nA:\nSome differences in totals across the PLD dashboard may occur because we do not always have complete data for every HCP. For example, a provider might appear in overall counts but be excluded from certain views if specific details—like age or gender—are missing.\nQ: If multiple target lists are combined, can you report out by each list?\nA:\nOmnichannel audiences in PLD can be reported only by audience, not by the underlying target lists once combined. If reporting by individual target lists is required, please keep the lists separate. Otherwise, feel free to combine them into a single audience.\nMatch rates\nQ: Are match rates available for matching an HCP in PulsePoint to their LinkedIn accounts pre-activation?\nA\n: Omnichannel Audience match rates and the estimated audience size targeted via each external platform (e.g., LinkedIn) will vary depending on the HCP target lists used, the targeting methodology utilized by the platform, and the number of account users targeted on each platform.\nLinkedIn provides an Estimated Target Audience Size based on their methodology to size an audience that PulsePoint sends them. In many cases, it is more than the target list count. This is due to factors like modeling based on partial matches, inclusion of users across LinkedIn and LinkedIn Audience Network, as well as estimation methods that account for potential reach rather than exact list size. These estimates often reflect broader targeting and delivery assumptions rather than a strict match to your original audience.\nForecasting\nQ: How can a user forecast for Omnichannel Audiences?\nA\n: Since the actual campaign is set up and run by the client within their own social media Business Manager account, clients can use their social media platform’s forecasting tool to predict impressions, clicks, etc.\nActivation / Contact\nQ: How can a user request access to Omnichannel Audiences?\nA\n: Please inform your dedicated Sales Rep and Account Manager to set up the appropriate user access to Omnichannel Audiences (LinkedIn) after all\naforementioned requirements\nhave been met.\nQ: What if the employee who authenticated access for Omnichannel Audiences is deactivated?\nA\n: Deactivating the authenticated user will break the connection with the LinkedIn API to sync audiences. Please re-authenticate with another user who has the correct access. Once authenticated, please let your PulsePoint account manager know.\nQ: Why am I not seeing any accounts available in Omnichannel Audiences for LinkedIn?\nA\n: For LinkedIn, there is an additional step to display the LinkedIn account(s) under the desired PulsePoint Account and Advertiser. Please reach out to your Account Manager to link them together.",

(BB)\nTargeting vs. Blocking\nIMPORTANT\nBlocking\nalways\nsupersedes targeting within the same targeting type and across all other targeting types.\nSame targeting type:\nIf you target\nEndocrine System Diseases\n, and block subcategory\nDiabetes Mellitus\n,\nDiabetes Mellitus\nwill never be targeted.\nMultiple targeting types:\nIf you target\nfemales,\nand block age\n25-29,\nfemales in that age group will\nnever\nbe targeted.\nStructure of Targeting Types\nA targeting type contains one or more tabs. e.g.,\nTargeting Multiple Rules\nWithin each targeting type, an impression is targeted if\nany of the criteria\nare met (i.e., OR'd together), unless otherwise indicated.\nIf you enable more than one targeting type, an impression is targeted if it matches the criteria within\nall targeting types\n(i.e., AND'd together).\nEXAMPLE\nIf you target:\nAge:\n35-39\n,\n40-44\nEthnicity:\nAfrican American\n,\nCaucasian\nYour ads will target people in age groups\n35-39\nor\n40-44\n, but only if their ethnicity is\nAfrican American\nor\nCaucasian\n.\nDelete Button\nCAUTION\nUnless otherwise specified, the\nbutton (A) deletes\nall items\nfrom\nall tabs\nin a targeting type.\nT\nhere is no confirmation prompt\n.\nA tab is defined as an option on the\nleft-hand side of the screen\n.

The icons listed below display on the Tactic Page next to the targeted entities.\nNOTE\nOn the Tactic Page, the icon for the last three settings appears next to the targeting type. e.g.,\nPerson\n)\nUnless stated otherwise in the specific targeting type article, , the options are as follows.\nDevice:\nTarget all browsers/devices in this audience.\nPerson:\nTarget all browsers/devices associated with the people in this audience.\nHousehold:\nTarget all devices in the household of the people in this audience.\nHousehold IP:\nTarget all devices in the household IP of the people in this audience.\nPlus\nall devices currently connected to the home's IP such as untrackable iPhone, iPads, and CTV devices.\nManaging Categories\nIMPORTANT\nBlocking\nalways\nsupersedes targeting within the same targeting type and across all other targeting types.\nSame targeting type:\nIf you target\nEndocrine System Diseases\n, and block subcategory\nDiabetes Mellitus\n,\nDiabetes Mellitus\nwill never be targeted.\nMultiple targeting types:\nIf you target\nfemales,\nand block age\n25-29,\nfemales in that age group will\nnever\nbe targeted.\nThis section explains how to manage targeting types that support a hierarchical taxonomy.\nIt also explains how the Life application handles multiple categories.\nThese concepts apply to targeting such as:\nAny targeting type containing health conditions/treatments such as\nHealth Pages\n(which we use in the examples below), or\nHealth Populations\n.\nIAB Categories\n.\nAny targeting type containing HCP Specialties such as\nHCP by Specialty\nor\nPractice Staff\n.\nWhen you target a category, all sub-categories are targeted by default. In some cases, specific sub-categories may not be listed, but they will still be targeted within the parent.\nIf you wish to exclude a subcategory whose parent is targeted, you must block it.\nMeSH Category Hierarchy\nYou can target conditions and treatments (e.g., for the\nHealth Pages\ntargeting type) via\nMeSH\n(Medical Subject Heading) hierarchies.\nIf you choose an expandable category, all descendants will be automatically included. You can explicitly target/block only items with a checkmark (\n) and block symbol (\n) next to them. (e.g., you can click the checkmark/block symbol for\nDiabetes Complications\nbut not for\nDiabetic Angiopathies\n.) To explicitly target such a category (circled in the above screenshot), please contact your Platform Solutions Manager at\nlifesupport@pulsepoint.com\n.\nItems Belonging to Multiple Categories\nIf a condition or treatment you wish to target (e.g.,\nUrinary Tract Infections\n)\nfalls under more than one higher-level category (hypothetical example:\nMale Urogenital Diseases\nand\nBacterial Infections\n),\nyou need to target only one of these categories.\nPages Belonging to Multiple Categories\nA web page can belong to multiple categories (e.g.,\nEndocrine System Diseases\nand\nDiabetes Mellitus\n), based on contextualization. If a page belongs to at least one category you are targeting, it will be served\nunless\nyou are also blocking at least one of the other categories the page belongs to. For example:\nIf a page belongs to both:\nEndocrine System\nDiseases\n(top-level category)\nDiabetes Mellitus\n(second-level category)\nAnd you are:\nTargeting\nEndocrine System Diseases.\nBlocking\nDiabetes Mellitus.\nThe page will not be served.\nThe inverse is true as well:\nIf a page belongs to both:\nEndocrine System Diseases\n(top-level category)\nDiabetes Mellitus\n(second-level category)\nAnd you are:\nBlocking\nEndocrine System Diseases\n.\nTargeting\nDiabetes Mellitus.\nThe page will not be served.\nThe same logic applies if a page's categories are not part of the same hierarchy (e.g.,\nMental Disorders\nand\nOccupational Diseases\n).\nBehavior of Checkmark/Block Symbol\nFor conditions and treatments only:\nIf you have targeted any subset of an item's children, the main item's checkmark displays in light green (\n) instead of bold green (\n), which means all items are targeted. Inversely, if you block any subset of an item's children, the main item's Block symbol displays in light red. (\n) instead of bold red (\n), which means all items are blocked.\nEXAMPLE\n-\nTarget Parent Category/Block Sub-Categories:\nExpand the category and change the sub-category settings as needed per the example below.\nYou have targeted the top-level category (\nEndocrine System Diseases\n) (A), and, by definition, its sub-categories.\nYou have blocked\nParathyroid Diseases\n. (B)\nThe light green checkmark next to the top-level category (\nEndocrine System Diseases\n), indicates that only a subset of the sub-categories is targeted. (A)\nThe light red Block symbol next to the top-level category (\nEndocrine System Diseases\n), indicates that only a subset of the sub-categories is blocked. (A)\nParathyroid Diseases\nis blocked since blocking supersedes targeting. (B)\nUnless otherwise indicated in the article for a particular targeting type:\nIf\nyou\nselect all sub-categories (but not their immediate parent)\nwe\nautomatically target the parent. (If\nyou\ntarget the parent,\nwe\nmay target sub-categories not explicitly listed.\nFilter on Selected Items\nSome targeting types contain an option to display only selected items.\nEXAMPLE\n- for Behavioral Segments, you have four segments either targeted or blocked per the search criteria\nailment\n. (Please note that this screenshot does not necessarily represent a realistic configuration.)\nIf you click (e.g.)\n, only the selected (targeted or blocked) segments that meet your search criteria display. (Again, p\nlease note that this scenario does not necessarily represent a realistic configuration.)\nTo return to the full list, click (e.g.)\n.

This segment is made available to maximize the brand safety protection for especially cautious bidders by allowing them to exclude impressions in their avoidance categories or where the brand safety status is unknown.\nAggregated: All High Severity Content\nThis tier groups together the avoidance categories most explicit and commonly used by DV advertiser clients within their brand safety profile.\nAdult Content: Pornography, Mature Topics & Nudity\nMature topics that are inappropriate viewing for children including explicit language, content, sounds and themes.\nDrugs/Alcohol/Controlled Substances: Substance Abuse\nContent about using drugs and alcohol for recreational instead of medicinal purposes, including illegal, prescription or OTC drugs. It excludes sites about addiction and the negative effect of drugs.\nExtreme Graphic/Explicit Violence/Weapons\nContent related to intense, disturbing or severe content as well as physical harm of oneself or others and depictions or discussions of weapons such as guns or knives.\nHate Speech/Profanity\nContent that is profane, containing words that are generally considered obscene, vulgar or derogatory, including language biased language towards an individual or group based on their race, nationality, gender, sexual orientation, religion or disability. Examples of hate content include articles about race-related controversies or violence, hate crimes, the KKK, holocaust or holocaust deniers, as well as vicious or derogatory language in article comments.\nIllegal Activities: Criminal Skills\nPromotion and instructions for performing actions considered illegal, forbidden or harmful to the public. It does not reflect the laws of any specific region or country or include crime prevention.\nIncentivized/Malware/Clutter\nContent associated with malicious online practices such as malware, viruses, spam, adware, ad clutter and incentivized traffic.\nPiracy/Copyright Infringement\nSites, presently or historically, associated with access to copyrighted material (movies, music, books, etc.) without appropriate controls, licensing, or permission via methods including, but not limited to, streaming, downloads, peer-to-peer and search. The Copyright Infringement category does not in any way characterize the site itself as being directly or indirectly engaged in illegal behavior. As used in this category definition, the term \"Copyright Infringement\" does not represent legal language as defined in various laws, statutes and ordinances or as conventionally used in courts or other legal proceedings, but rather a custom definition strictly for advertising classification purposes.\nAggregated: All Medium Severity Content\nThis tier groups together the avoidance categories that are more selectively used by advertisers to customize their brand safety profile.\nAd Server\nTechnology for serving ads online. Sites to which this category is assigned rarely contain content.\nAdult Content: Swimsuit\nContent that shows images of women in bikinis, or men and women in swimsuits, without showing overtly sexual or adult content.\nControversial Subjects: Alternative Lifestyles\nSexual practices, dress or recreation habits which some consumers consider non-mainstream. Sites may not be pornographic but include content that is sexual in nature (i.e., a website about nudists).\nControversial Subjects: Celebrity Gossip\nRumor, innuendo or sensational reports about celebrities. Celebrity gossip has a more salacious tone than celebrity news, which falls under the Entertainment category.\nControversial Subjects: Gambling\nContent promoting gambling and betting.

The data on the chart below represents the sum of the\nSite\nand\nSearch\nchannels. It displays how effective PulsePoint has been in identifying NPIs.\nPrivate Notes [6/13:1]\nPlease review definitions, in particular:\nIs verb \"originating\" correct? I liked it better than \"initiated\" or \"made\".\nFor Identified NPIs, should the syntax be same as above 3 events (that's how it is in the application, but thinking we could be more consistent.)\n---\nDEFINITIONS (Event-Based)\nEvents\n: An Event is a recorded interaction made by a user. Example\nEvents\nare clicks, impressions, pageviews, email opens, etc.\nTotal Events:\nTotal Events are the total count of\nevents\ninitiated by a user, who may or may not be an HCP. (BB)\nHCP Events:\nThe total count of\nevents\nthat were made by an HCP, but may or may not have an NPI number linked with the events.

(DD)\nPercent =\n100\n* (\nNPI Search Clicks / HCP Events\n) (DD2)\nSubtract\nNPI Events\nfrom\nHCP Events\nto calculate the number of HCP Events that do not have a linked NPI number. Per the above screenshot,\n18,719 - 14,036 = 4,683\nIdentified NPIs:\nDistinct count of NPIs, that HCP365 has identified at the individual level, who have been exposed to an event. (AA)\nPoP:\nPeriod over period measure comparing the prior Time Frame to the selected Time Frame.

Example:\nSite + Search\nmeasures a specific HCP clicking on a search campaign ad\nand\nlanding on the brand's site).\nNPI Events by Channel and Specialty\nThis graph visualizes the specialties with the most events, broken down by channel.\nData is broken down by channels:\nMedia:\nImpression-related event. (Dark purple bar.)\nSearch:\nSearch click related event. (Light purple bar.)\nSite:\nPageview-related event. (Green bar.)\nEmail:\nEmail campaign-related event. (Gray bar.)\nSocial:\nSocial click-related event. (Orange bar.)\nFilter metrics by clicking legend.\nShare of Non-HCPs, HCPs and NPIs Events by Channel\nThis graph facilitates comparing a user type's share of events within the channel where the event occurred. Total share % for each column/channel (e.g.,\nSearch\n,\nSite\n) sums to\n100%\nover\nNPI\n/\nHCP\n/\nNon-HCP\n.

You can easily add or remove optimizations to maximize campaign goals. This approach improves campaign efficiency using our premium data foundation.\nThese strategies occur\nafter\nthe audience is set. They\ndo not\ndetermine who is in your audience segment.\nOptimization Details:\nMedia Optimization\nis required and defaults to\nCPM\n. (Select one.)\nAdaptive Optimization\nis optional. (Select one.)\nMedia Optimization\nMedia Optimization occurs\nafter\nthe audience is set. It\ndoes not\ndetermine who is in your audience segment. Instead, it refines when and how pre-approved audience cohorts are prioritized, based on real-time programmatic signals.\nEXAMPLES\n-\nFrequency (Not for\nFrequency Capping\n. Instead, this algorithm would prioritize and score cohorts depending on their recent media exposure.)\nPrice\nPlacement\nViewability\nGoal alignment\nSelect Media Optimization.\n(DEFAULT):\nCPM:\nWe will constantly adjust our bid price to try to get you the lowest cost per impression\n.\nCPC\n: (Cost Per Click)\nFlat:\nAlways bid Base Bid Price.\nCTR:\nClick-Through Rate: Optimize your tactic to try to achieve your specified CTR goal as best we can while remaining on pace. Enter CTR Goal you hope to achieve:\nCPA\n: (Cost Per Acquisition)\nReach Optimization:\nThese strategies maximize the number of unique users served. We do so by adjusting your bid price, based on how many impressions a user has already received versus all other exposed users. This algorithm facilitates attaining maximum possible reach, while staying on pace.\nTactic Reach:\nCONSIDERS IMPRESSIONS FROM: This tactic only.\nOPTIMIZES: Unique reach of this tactic by modifying bid price of this one tactic.\nLine Item Reach:\nCONSIDERS IMPRESSIONS FROM: All tactics belonging to same line item.\nOPTIMIZES: Unique reach of this line item by modifying bid price of this one tactic.\nCampaign Reach:\nCONSIDERS IMPRESSIONS FROM: All tactics belonging to same campaign.\nOPTIMIZES: Unique reach of this campaign by modifying the bid price of this one tactic.\nAdaptive Optimization\nTM\nAdaptive Optimization occurs\nafter\nthe audience is set. It\ndoes not\ndetermine who is in your audience segment. It is a privacy-first AI bidding solution exclusive to PulsePoint, offering additional methods to prioritize ad delivery to your most valuable pre-approved audience cohorts. It leverages media and clinical insights from our premium data foundation, such as contextual signals, condition prevalence, and prescription activity, to enhance performance at every digital engagement opportunity. This new bidding category enables media optimizations (e.g., CPM) to run alongside our proprietary models, including Audience Quality and HCP Clinical Behavior, to maximize performance at every moment.\nNOTE\nAdaptive Optimization is not supported if you have selected any of these\nMedia Optimizations\n:\nFlat\nReach (Tactic, Line Item, Campaign)\nAdaptive Optimizations may incur an additional data cost CPM.\nSelect Adaptive Optimization.\nDTC Audience Quality:\nLeverages clinical prevalence to automatically prioritize ad spend on the highest-value, diagnosis-relevant populations, or those most likely to have the diagnosis specified by a brand.\nSpecify one or more diagnoses. The optimization will apply if\nany\nof the specified conditions are matched.\nNOTES\n-\nSelecting a single diagnosis or a few related diagnoses will render optimal results.\nIf you select multiple, unrelated diagnoses, this optimization will not work properly.\nFor info on using this optimization strategy in conjunction with\nOTC Populations Targeting\n, please contact your Platform Solutions Manager at\nlifesupport@pulsepoint.com\n.\nHCP\nClinical Behavior:\nA bidding optimization strategy utilized to optimize ad spend toward HCPs most likely to prescribe a target script, given their historical digital and clinical activity. It prioritizes any or all of the following:\nBidding on brand-relevant digitally engaged HCPs.\nHCPs who have not recently prescribed the brand.\nHCPs who have prescribed competitive drugs/complimentary treatments.\nHINT\n- For optimal results, include the\nDrug\n(required)\nand\nMarket Basket Drug\nfields in\nCampaign Details\n. If needed, please contact your Platform Solutions Manager at\nlifesupport@pulsepoint.com\nfor assistance with the campaign's Market Basket Drugs.\nCPC Optimization\nThe CPC Optimization algorithm automatically adjusts bids and improves cost efficiency while maintaining ad click performance. It leverages machine learning and real-time data to dynamically optimize bid amounts to deliver smarter, more effective campaign results.\nKey benefits:\nCost Efficiency:\nReduces Cost Per Click while maintaining traffic quality.\nAutomated Adjustments:\nDynamically adapts bids based on real-time performance data.\nImproved ROI:\nEnsures ad spend is allocated efficiently to drive better results.\nScalability:\nWorks across multiple campaigns and budgets without manual intervention.\nNOTE\n- CPC Optimization is not supported for DOOH tactics or on CTV devices.\nCPA Optimization\nCPA (Cost Per Acquisition) optimization automatically prioritizes ad delivery and spend toward HCP and consumer audiences most likely to perform specific actions on a brand’s website.

      "title": "Bid Multipliers - Overview",
      "content": "Introduction\nBid multipliers support multiplying your CPM Bid Price up/down based on various criteria. By leveraging this feature, you can increase/decrease the $amount you bid on for a given set of impressions. Bid multipliers are applied to your Bid Price at the\ntactic\nlevel. This document summarizes how to configure them.\nThe\nTactic Page\ncontains a section under the SETTINGS tab for\nassigning bid multipliers\n.\nIf no bid multipliers exist, click\n. Otherwise, click\n.\nWe support various bid multipliers, including the following.\nFor tactics belonging to DOOH line items, we support only:\nGeo Targets\nDevice\nI\nnventory Sourc\ne\nAdditional bid multiplier (\nAudience Multiplier\n).\nNOTES\nBid multipliers are supported for the following\nline item types\n:\nDisplay\nAudio\nVideo\nDOOH\nSome bid multipliers are not supported for all line item types.\nEntering Bid Multipliers\nSample screen:\nTo set a bid multiplier, enter that value (e.g.,\n0.1\n,\n0.5\n,\n1.25\n,\n1.5\n,\n2\n).\nWe support up to two decimal places.\nEnter\n0\nto prevent bidding on a specific subset of inventory.\nAny unset bid multipliers default to\n1.00\n, which will be ignored. Use this value to unset a previously set bid multiplier.\nIf you have enabled multiple bid multipliers (e.g.,\nage\nand\nbrowser\n), we take the\nmaximum\nrelevant multiplier,\nunless one or more relevant bid multipliers is\n0\n, in which case you will not bid on this inventory.\nEXAMPLE\nIf you have the following settings:\nBid Price =\n$3.00\n.\nBid multiplier for females is\n1.5\n. (No bid multiplier for males.)\nBid multiplier for age range\n35-39\nis\n2\n(No bid multiplier for other age ranges.)\nNo other bid multipliers exist.\nResultant behavior:\nFor females between\n35\nand\n39\nyears old, you will bid\n$6.00\n(\n2\nx\n$3.00\n).\nBecause\n2\n(for age) represents the maximum relevant bid multiplier (\n1.5\nand\n2\n).\nFor a\n46\n-year old female, you will bid\n$4.50\n(\n1.5\nX\n$3.00\n).\nBecause\n1.5\n(for gender) is the only bid multiplier that applies to this bid request.\nFor a\n32\n-year old male, you will bid\n$6.00\n(\n2\nX\n$3.00\n).\nBecause\n2\n(for age) is the only bid multiplier that applies to this bid request.\nOn the other hand, if the bid multiplier for age range\n35\n-\n39\nis\n0\n, you will not bid on inventory for females aged\n35\n-\n39\n, or anyone within that age range.\nDisplay on Tactic Page\nOnce you add bid multipliers, they display on the Tactic Page.\nView/Edit Bid Multiplier\nClick bid multiplier name (e.g.,\nDay of the Week\n) to edit/view.\nGlobal Commands\nWhile the specific criteria and user interface differ between bid multipliers, certain commands apply to most or all bid multipliers.\nIn the example below, the\nKeywords\nbid multiplier consists of two tabs:\nLists\n(Shown here)\nKeywords\n- Deletes\nall\nvalues (sets them all to\n1.00\n) and exits the bid multiplier screen. (A)\nIf a bid multiplier has multiple tabs\n(per the above screenshot)\n, this command applies to all tabs, except for\nGeo Targets\n, for which only the current tab is deleted.\nTo remove (unset) one bid multiplier value, set it to\n1.00\n.\nWhere applicable, click the column header for MULT column, or the criteria column (e.g., AGE) to sort.\nIf you sort the MULT column, values of\n1.00\nwill appear at the bottom of the list (if you are sorting in descending order) or the top of the list (if you are sorting in ascending order) because\n1.00\nmeans there is no bid multiplier.\nFilter on Active Bid Multipliers\nFor some bid multiplier types, we have an option to display only active bid multipliers. (Whose value is not\n1.00\n.)\nEXAMPLE\nFor Geo Targets, you have five bid multipliers enabled at county level. When you first access this screen, it appears as follows:\nHowever, if you click\n, only the active bid multipliers display:\n---\nNOTE\nFor some multi-level taxonomies, if your matched bid multiplier data is below the first level of the taxonomy, only the top level displays. You must manually expand the parent categor(ies) to view the enabled bid multipliers. In some cases, you may need to go down more than one level.\nTo return to the full list, click (e.g.)\n. (The name of this option will differ, depending on what tab you are on.)\nSearch\nWe provide a SEARCH option for some bid multipliers. For example, for\nGeo Target,\nDMA\ntab, you can search on DMA Name or DMA Code. (Leveraging DMA Codes facilitates identifying a DMA when there are multiple DMAs with same name.)",

Whatever budget cannot be delivered by these Priority\n1\ntactics will be allocated to the Priority\n2\ntactics, etc. (This field can alternatively contain the percentage of your remaining budget to allocate, or a dollar amount to allocate.)\n>\nNOTE\n- If you are entering a line item's first tactic, priority defaults to\n1\n. Otherwise, it defaults to lowest-priority tactic for this line item. e.g., if a line item has tactics with priorities\n1\n,\n7\n, and\n5\n, default =\n7\n.\n>\nNOTE\n- If you have no preference as to how the line item budget is distributed between tactics, you can set all tactics to same priority.\nIf the parent line item's cost model is CPM, default behavior applies:\nBase Bid Price:\nYour actual bid price will normally vary between\n$0.01\nand the Base Bid Price, depending on your Optimization Strategy.

      "content": "Search Extension Line Items support\nSearch Extension Creatives\n. They differ from other line item types (e.g., their tactics are called\nad groups\n, and behave somewhat differently). When you create this type of line item, you can upload a bulk sheet containing the necessary info, as described in this article. You can also\nmanually enter the line item's ad groups, and assign creatives (either existing or new) to them.\nImport Bulk Sheet\nThis option applies only if you are creating a new line item or if the line item does not contain any ad groups.\nFor Search Extension Line Items, you have the option of importing a spreadsheet that will create new enabled ad group(s) and pre-approved creative(s).\nThe following section appears at the bottom of the Line Item\nDetails\nTab\nDo one of the following:\nTo create a new Bulk Sheet, proceed to\nDownload Template/Configure Bulk Sheet\n. (A)\nTo import (upload) an existing Bulk Sheet, proceed to\nSelect Bulk Sheet\n. (B)\nDownload Template/Configure Bulk Sheet\nWe recommend configuring a bulk sheet from our template. Click\n(A), open the Excel (XLSX) file, and save it with a different filename to a folder other than\nDownloads\n. (Otherwise, create a spreadsheet per the guidelines below, either before, or during this process.)\nBefore going any further, determine the ad group names, and associated data, as described below.\nSpreadsheet Format\nThe Excel file contains two sheets:\nCreatives:\nContains creative data, including the ad group the creative will be added to.\nKeywords:\nAssociates keywords with ad groups via the\nSearch Keywords\ntargeting type.\nCreatives Sheet\nFormat:\nOne row per creative.\nEnter info for creative(s). The columns map to the\nSearch Extension Creative\nscreen as follows.\nBulk Sheet Field\nCreative Field\nRemarks\nHeadline\nHeadline\nDescription\nDescription\nURL\nClickthrough URL\nFull URL to which user should be directed when clicking ad (e.g., https://my-url.com).\nDisplay Domain\nDisplay URL\nPlaceholder (full URL) which user clicks to view ad. (The actual URL may differ; see\nClickthrough URL\nabove.)\nAd Group\nCreative name (derived from Ad Group, etc.)\n<\nAd Group\n>\n_\n\"\nCreative\n\"\n[\nX\n]\n_\n<\nAdSize\n>\ne.g.,\nSteveGrp One\n_Creative\n1\n_\n300_250\nHardcoded elements in\nblack\n.\nSee NOTE below.\nNOTES\nFor each creative in the spreadsheet, we create a series of\nfour\ncreatives (one for each of the supported ad sizes for Search Extension Creatives). We append the ad size to the creative name. (e.g.,\nSteveGrp_One_Creative1_\n300_250\n). See example below.\nX = 1\nfor first series of creatives linked to a particular ad group;\nX = 2\nfor the second series, etc. In the example below, the Creative Names below the spreadsheet are in sequence.\nEXAMPLE\nResultant series of creatives (with ad sizes\n300x250\n,\n300x600\n,\n320x50\n,\n728x90\n)\nSteveGrp One_Creative1_\n300_250\nSteveGrp One_Creative1_\n300_600\nSteveGrp One_Creative1_\n320_50\nSteveGrp One_Creative1_\n728_90\nSteveGrp Two_Creative1_\n300_250\nSteveGrp Two_Creative1_\n300_600\nSteveGrp Two_Creative1_\n320_50\nSteveGrp Two_Creative1_\n728_90\nSteveGrp Two_Creative2_\n<Suffix>\n(Four creatives, with\nsame suffixes\nas above.)\nSteveGrp One_Creative2 _\n<Suffix>\n(Four creatives,\nwith same suffixes as above\n.)\nSteveGrp Two_Creative3_\n<Suffix>\n(Four creatives, with\nsame suffixes\nas above.)\nKeywords Sheet\nFormat:\nOne row per keyword belonging to a particular ad group.\nEnter keyword(s) for one or more ad groups that will be applied to the\nSearch Keywords\ntargeting type. A keyword can be a single word (e.g.,\nacne)\nor phrase (e.g.,\nbone density\n).\nEXAMPLE\nSave Spreadsheet, etc.\nSave filled-in spreadsheet and close file.\nProceed to\nSelect Bulk Sheet\n.\nSelect Bulk Sheet\nNOTE\nYou can modify an existing bulk sheet in Excel before uploading.\nSelect bulk sheet by dragging/dropping or browsing computer. The application will create new ad groups containing search keywords and new creatives.\nClick\nto create the creatives and ad groups.\nIf you are creating a new line item, you will be taken from the line item's\nDetails\nTab to its\nOverview\nTab. Otherwise, you remain on the\nDetails\nTab.\nTo view/modify an ad group:\nSelect from the drop-down menu on\nLeft-Hand Navigation Bar\n.\nVerify/modify its data by proceeding to\nNewly Created Ad Group(s)\nbelow.\nTo view/modify another ad group, return to step\n4-a\n.\nIf parent line item is disabled, and you are ready to deliver these ad groups, enable the line item:\nClick line item on\nLeft-Hand Navigation Bar\n.\nIf toggle at upper-right of screen is\nDisabled\n, click to enable.\nNewly Created Ad Group(s)\nThe DETAILS, SETTINGS and CREATIVES tabs on the Ad Group Page will reflect your uploaded data. If needed, review and modify your data for each ad group.\nClick\nDETAILS\nat top of screen to proceed to\nDetails\nTab. (A)\nDETAILS Tab\nMake any changes.\nIf you have made changes, click\n.\nClick\nSETTINGS\nat top of screen to proceed to\nSettings\nTab. (A)\nSETTINGS Tab\nSearch Keywords\nTargeting Type: In this example, we have added five keywords, based on the uploaded spreadsheet. Modify as needed. (A)\nMake any other changes.\nIf you have made changes, click\n.\nClick\nCREATIVES\nat top of screen to proceed to\nCreatives\nTab. (B)\nCREATIVES Tab\nNOTE\nCreatives are arranged by ad size.\nEach of the two original creatives in the bulk sheet spawned a series of four pre-approved creatives, per the below ad sizes, for a total of eight. We suffix each creative name with the ad size (e.g.,\nSAK-Group 1_Creative 1_\n300_250\n)\n300x250\n300x600\n320x50\n728x50\nYou can do the following:\nAdd creatives.\nPulsePoint must approve any creatives you create. (CC)\nRemove creatives from ad group. (The creatives themselves will remain on file.)\nTo edit the creatives themselves, click creative name. (For more info, see\nSearch Extension Creatives\n.) (AA)\nPulsePoint may need to re-approve modified creatives.\nBy default, weights are distributed evenly within each section of ad sizes. (BB)\nThe percent for any unapproved creatives will be\nzero\nuntil approval.\nChange if needed. e.g.,\n70%\nof all bids for creative size\n300x250\nwill use the first creative.\nIf you made any changes, click\n.\nIf parent line item is disabled, and you are ready to deliver these ad groups, enable the line item:\nClick the line item on\nLeft-Hand Navigation Bar\n.\nIf toggle at upper-right of screen is\nDisabled\n, click to enable line item.\nAccess Another Ad Group\nSelect from the drop-down menu in the\nLeft-Hand Navigation Bar\n.\nVerify/modify its data by retuning to\nNewly Created Ad Group(s)\n.",

These keywords match a word (or phrase) that can appear anywhere on a web page the user is currently on.\nNOTE\nA keyword can be a single word or phrase (e.g.,\ninfluenza\n,\nstrep throat\n,\npsychiatry\n,\ninternal medicine\n).\nHINT\nIf you are targeting multiple related conditions and want to allocate more spend/delivery toward a specific condition, or pull reports to understand which condition has the most engaged audience, create\none tactic per target audience/condition\n. This method facilitates pulling reports by\ntactic\nand easily viewing performance by\ntarget\n.\nNOTES\nTo preview the keywords generated (for matching) when you target a particular keyword condition, and/or to generate your own keyword list:\nMouse over the keyword condition.\nClick\n.\nProceed to\nKeyword Preview/Create List\n(D).\nThe data cost (CPM) displays in the lower-left corner. (E)\nSelect which language(s) the matched terms should be in. (e.g., if you choose\nFrench\nand\nItalian\n, we look for web pages that contain your keyword(s) in any of these languages.) (A)\nSearch for keyword. (B)\nClick\nto target or\nto block condition keywords. (C)\n>\nNOTE\n- If you choose an expandable condition, all descendants will be automatically included.\nRepeat steps\n2\n-\n3\nas needed.\nClick\n.\nKeyword Preview/Create List\nUse this feature to view the list of keywords to match on a page for each condition, and to create your own keyword lists from our list. You arrived here by clicking\nnext to a condition keyword, in this case\nBile Duct Diseases\n.\nThe following screen displays the actual content that will be targeted if you selected the above entity in the hierarchy. Per this example, if you target\nBile Duct Diseases\n, and a page contains\nAcalculous Cholecystitis\n, we consider it a match.\nReview List Without Making Changes/Copy to Clipboard\nYou can:\nAdd/Remove languages to match against as needed.

One keyword group can be targeted, and a different group can be blocked. Unlike predefined custom lists, these lists are created on-the-fly, at the time you configure your keyword targeting type.

(C)\nNumber of Prescribers/Rxs\nThis section summarizes pertinent dashboard data: prescribers, patients of prescribers, and prescriptions of the target drug.\nDEFINITIONS\n>\nRx\n- Prescription (drug) that has been filled.\n>\nTRx\n- Total prescriptions filled.\nDrug Name:\nThe drug that the Clinical Insights dashboard is based on.\nIn the\nDrug\nfield under Campaign Details\n, enter the brand name or NDC of the drug related to your campaign. (1)\nLine Item Duration:\nTotal duration of the line item. (2)\nMeasurement Period:\nStart of line item until most recent date clinical data is available, unless a\ncustom date range\nis selected. Clinical data is refreshed Thursdays and Fridays with a four-week lag. If the line item started less than four weeks ago, data will not yet be visible in the dashboard. (3)\nExposed Prescribers:\nThe number of HCP prescribers who have been exposed to the line item. (4)\nOverall Prescribers:\nAll HCPs who have prescribed the drug that was also filled, regardless of whether they have been exposed. (5)\nPatients Under Exposed Prescribers:\nThe number of patients prescribed the selected drug from prescribers who have been exposed to the line item. (6)\nPatients Under Overall Prescribers:\nThe number of patients who filled the selected drug from all prescribers, regardless of whether the prescribers have been exposed. (7)\nAvg TRx Per Overall Prescribers:\nThe average total number of filled prescriptions for the selected drug across all prescribing HCPs during the measurement time frame, regardless of whether the HCP was exposed. (8)\nAvg TRx Per Exposed Prescriber:\nThe average total number of filled prescriptions for the selected drug for exposed HCPs. (9)\nHINT\n- Compare the average TRx (total prescription) between overall prescribers (8) and exposed prescribers (9) to measure campaign influence on CLV (Customer Lifetime Value).\n(\nBack to top of Line Item Page\n)\nTrend Line\nUse this graph to compare how your line item is influencing new prescribers, current prescribers, and prescriptions each day.\nNOTE\nThe granularity (e.g.,\nDay\n,\nWeek\n,\nMonth\n), which you set in\nDashboard Filters\n, displays directly below the graph. (A)\nNew Prescribers - Exposed:\nExposed HCPs who had not written a prescription for the selected drug one year before the start of the line item, but have written one or more prescriptions for the selected drug post-impression. (10 -\nRed Line\n)\nPrescribers - Exposed\n: Exposed HCPs who have written one or more prescriptions for the selected drug during the measurement period. (11 -\nBlue Line\n)\nPrescriptions - Exposed\n: Prescriptions written by HCPs who have been exposed to an impression during measurement period. (12-\nGreen Line\n)\nHINTS\nHover over a graph line to view metric(s).\nFilter metrics by clicking legend. (10, 11, 12)\n(\nBack to top of Line Item Page\n)\nTop Five Professions/Specialties\nThis section displays the top five HCP Professions/Specialties in terms of prescribers exposed to an impression, and all prescribers, based on prescribing behavior.\nTop 5 Profession/Specialty - Exposed Prescribers:\nA combined look at the top professions and/or specialties prescribing the drug that also saw an impression for the corresponding line item. (13)\nTop 5 Profession/Specialty - Overall Prescribers:\nA combined look at the top professions and/or specialties prescribing the drug regardless of whether the prescriber was exposed to the impression. (14)\nHINT\n- Compare the campaign’s performance with the market’s overall performance, for which HCP professions and specialties are prescribing the selected drug at higher or lower rates. This can help in allocating campaign resources such as:\nChanging\nNPI Smart List\nTM\ndecile criteria\n.\nSetting\nfrequency caps\n, for certain HCP professions and specialties. To do so:\nEnter a\nfrequency cap\n, for a tactic, and target HCPs via the\nHCP by Specialty Targeting Type\n.\n(\nBack to top of Line Item Page\n)\nExposed Prescriber Geography\nThis section displays exposed prescribers by state and ZIP Code.\nDEFINITION\nExposed Prescriber\n- An HCP who has prescribed this drug and has been exposed to this line item.\nExposed Prescriber Geography:\nView the locations where exposed HCPs who are prescribing the selected drug are registered. This can help in customizing campaign geography criteria.\nBy State (15a)\nBy ZIP Code (15b)\nHINT\n- Hover over purple dots to view Exposed Prescribers by ZIP Code.\n(\nBack to top of Line Item Page\n)\nPrescribers Behavior\nThis section contains three charts, doing a deeper drive into HCPs who have been exposed to an impression, and displaying their changes in prescribing behavior.\nNOTE\nNPI Smart Lists\nsupport monitoring HCP\nprescription behavior change\n.\nTop New Prescribers:\nThe top 10 HCPs who have not written a prescription for the selected drug in the year before start of line item, but have written one or more prescriptions for the selected drug post-impression. New prescribers are ranked by how many prescriptions they have written over the last 30\ndays before the end of measurement period. (16)\nIn-Line Item Prescription\ns: The sum of prescriptions for the Top New Prescribers since the start of the line item.\nNew Prescriber Data Coverage\n: To identify new prescribers, we look back at a prescriber’s writing behavior for the selected drug over the year prior to the start of the line item. However, our clinical data starts in 2021 so the percent denoted in this field will be less than 100% for older line items where 365 days of data is not available (e.g. 292 days = 80%). We will adjust our new prescriber look back accordingly based on how much clinical data is available to us.\n(17)\nTop Influenced Prescribers:\nThe top 10 exposed HCPs who have greatly increased their prescribing behavior over the last 4 weeks since the line item began. Influenced prescribers are ranked by the greatest difference between the number of new prescriptions they wrote between 4 weeks pre-impression and the most recent 4 weeks post-impression. (18)\nPoP difference (Period over Period)\n: The count and percentage difference in prescription behavior during 30 days before the start of the line item and the last 30 days of measurable data post-launch.\nTop Droppers:\nThe top 10 exposed HCPs who have greatly decreased their prescribing behavior over the last 4 weeks since the line item began. Top droppers are ranked by the greater the difference in the number of new prescriptions they did not write between 4 weeks pre-impression and the most recent 4 weeks post-impression. (19)\nPoP difference (Period over Period)\n: The count and percentage difference in prescription behavior during 30 days before the start of the line item and the last 30 days of measurable data post-launch.\n(\nBack to top of Line Item Page\n)",

It consists of three tabs:\nDetails\nSettings\nCreatives\nDEFINITIONS\nEach Line Item represents one portion of the campaign's budget.\nEach Line Item contains one or more tactics.\nA Tactic tells the system how to deliver a portion of the line item flight's budget.\nEach tactic acts independently from all others, and has its own targeting, optimization, and allocated portion of the line item flight's budget.\n---\nHINT\nMouse over status and red icons at top of page for additional info.\nDETAILS Tab\nFrom the\nDetails\nTab, you can edit basic tactic data and more. Click\nhere\nfor specific info about the fields.\nMiscellaneous Fields\nCustom Tactic Fields (A)\nOPTIONAL:\nYou can create custom fields for any tactic. When you do so, they will be available\nfor all tactics (and\nad groups\n) for all line items in current account\n. These fields can facilitate linking third party ad server IDs, media planning IDs, etc. to your Life tactics.\nFor reporting, you can leverage these fields by including them as dimensions (rows) when:\nCreating a report template\nRunning an on-demand report\nScheduling a report\n.\nNOTE\nCustom fields support a drop-down menu of acceptable values for reportable dimensions. This feature helps eliminate mistakes in data entry, which facilitates more accurate reporting.\nTo configure such a field, please contact your Platform Solutions Manager at\nlifesupport@pulsepoint.com\n.\nEnter/Modify Custom Field\nEnter desired value, or select from drop-down menu (see NOTE above).\nIf you are editing an existing tactic, click\n.\nAdd Custom Field\nFrom a tactic (or\nad group\n), click\n.\nEnter field name and click\n.\nEnter value for custom field.\n>\nNOTE\n- This field will be added to every tactic (and\nad group\n) in current account.\nTo add another custom field, return to step\n1\n.\nIf you are editing an existing tactic, click\n.\nEdit Custom Field Configuration\nNOTE\nWe support this function for optional fields\nonly\n.\nTo edit custom field name or delete entire field:\nFrom a tactic (or\nad group\n), click\n.\nYou can perform the following operations,\nwhich affect every tactic (and\nad group\n) of every line item in current account.\n> Change field name and click\n.\n> Delete field.

Other options--such as\nAdaptive Optimization\n--may incur an additional Data Cost CPM.\nHUMAN Pre-Bid and Post-Bid Protection (CPM Fee Applies) (B)\n(NEW!)\nWe are now using HUMAN Security pre-bid filtration and post-bid monitoring for invalid traffic across all supply requests. HUMAN evaluates\n100%\nof traffic to ensure maximum protection across all channels. HUMAN distinguishes between bot traffic and legitimate human traffic.\nThis protection is built into the platform and cannot be opted out of.\nThere is a transparent, nominal HUMAN fee at the tactic level. This safeguard is built into the platform\nfor all tactics\n, ensuring that all platform users are protected.\nYou can report on this field by including it as a metric (\nHUMAN Cost\n, under\nPerformance\n) in a\nreport template\n.\nNOTE\nPulsePoint offers an additional layer of protection through DoubleVerify\nR\n, via the\nBrand Safety and Suitability\ntargeting type. It offers curated filters to ensure brand-safe environments of your choosing.\nTargeting\nAdd Targeting Type\nIMPORTANT\nBlocking\nalways\nsupersedes targeting within the same targeting type and across all other targeting types.\nSame targeting type:\nIf you target\nEndocrine System Diseases\nand block subcategory\nDiabetes Mellitus\n,\nDiabetes Mellitus\nwill\nnever\nbe targeted.\nMultiple targeting types:\nIf you target\nfemales\nand block age\n25-29\n, females in that age group will\nneve\nr be targeted.\nIf you select multiple targeting types, your ads will be delivered only on inventory that meets\nevery targeting type's criteria\n.\nIf you wish to import a predefined set of targeting rules:\nClick\n.

Conversion pixels are pieces of code that track users who either viewed or clicked an ad, and then subsequently performed a specific action/conversion event on the site the pixel was placed.

Conversion pixels support designating which site actions are most important, allowing you to optimize your campaigns off conversion data, leading to increased ROI.\nYou can target these pixels in the\nConverters\nTargeting Type for an advertiser's campaigns. Also, in a tactic, you can designate a conversion pixel for\nCPA Optimization\n, which prioritizes ad delivery and spend toward HCP and consumer audiences most likely to perform specific actions on a brand's website.\nIMPORTANT\nFor the advertiser's campaigns: To enable tracking for a line item's tactics, you must associate the pixel with that line item via its\nConversion\ntab.\nCreate New Pixel\nNavigate to\nData Management --> Pixels\n.\nClick Create New Pixel\n.\nClick\nConversion Pixel\n.\nEnter name.\nSelect advertiser.\nSelect scope (cross-device support):\n>\nDevice\n-\nConversion must occur on same device/browser where the ad was shown.

PLEASE DO NOT SHARE\n***********************************************************\nIntroduction\nWhen you configure a scheduled report, you can specify custom destination(s) such as:\nFTP\nSFTP\nS3\nGCP\nWithin these destinations, you can specify\ncustomized paths and filenames\n, based on data elements such as campaign name and dates/times such as the start/end dates for the report.\nScheduling Custom Destination Report\nThese instructions presume you have\npopulated the upper portion of the above screen\n. Proceed as follows within the green outline.\nPrivate notes [9/21/23 SK}\nMike L - please verify step 2 - def'n for Event-Level Report\nMike's response:\nDEFINITIONS\nFile Path:\nThe path you specify on the SCHEDULE REPORT Screen.\nDestination Path:\nThe path you specify within a custom destination such as an FTP site.\nDeliver to:\nSelect\nCustom Destination\n.\nEvent-level Report:\nThese reports provide non-aggregated data at our most granular level. This data is essentially raw log data that can include all available fields.\n>\nNOTE\n- This option is supported only for Report Periods\nYesterday\nand\nLast # Days\n, where # is from\n1\nto\n7\n.\nDestination:\nDo either:\nSelect from destinations (such as FTP, SFTP, S3, GCP) configured for this account.\nClick\n. See\nhere\nfor info.\nSpecify a path via\nONE\nof the following methods:\n> On this screen, at report level. (Limit :\n235\ncharacters.) (A)\n>>\nNOTE\n- If you wish to apply macro(s) to path, click\nand\nselect macro(s)\n> Within a\nspecified custom destination\n.\nFile Name:\nEnter unique name for destination file you will retrieve.

You can examine these files to confirm your report's settings/criteria, or to troubleshoot the report.\nClick\n.\nMacros - Variables and Keys (A, B)\nNOTE\nIn this section, we use the terms\nvariables\nand\nmacros\ninterchangeably.\nDEFINITION\nA\nmacro\nis piece of placeholder code that tells a software application to insert predetermined value(s) at a later point (e.g., when generating a report).\nMacros facilitate configuring a dynamic report path and/or filename within your custom destination.\nClick\nnext to File Path and/or File Name to invoke. (A, B)\nYou can insert variables from one or more of the categories below,\ncombining\nas needed.\nGeneral Variables\nTime Variables\nCustom Keys\nGeneral Variables\nGeneral Variables correspond to campaign entities/filtering criteria (e.g.,\nCampaign, Line Item\n) on top half of SCHEDULE REPORT screen.\nProceed as follows for paths and filenames:\nREQUIRED\nIf you select (e.g.)\n$CampaignName$\n, you must be filtering on a specific campaign.\nClick variables (e.g.,\n$CampaignName$)\n.\nEdit path or filename as needed (e.g., add prefix or suffix).\nReturn to\nscheduling report\n.\nPRO TIP\nYou can create a directory path structure based on campaigns and line items, such as:\nReports/CampaignOne/LineItemOne\nReports/CampaignOne/LineItemTwo\nTime Variables\nPeriodStartTime:\nReport Period Start Date\nPeriodEndTime:\nReport Period End Date.\nReportDateTime:\nWhen report was run.\nTime Variables contain timestamps representing (e.g.) when report was run (e.g.,\n$ReportDateTime\n[yyyy-MM-dd]\n$)\n, The segment within the brackets is the date format within a path or filename. This nomenclature facilitates maintaining separate folders for each day a report is run, or creating a filename that includes the date.\nProceed as follows\nfor paths and filenames:\nEXAMPLE\nTo create a date in\nMMDDYYYY\nformat per the filename\nTestReport09202023\n, the format is\n%m%d%Y\nwhere:\n%m\n= Two-digit month\n%d\n= Two-digit day\n%Y\n= Four-digit year\nPrivate notes [9/21/23 SK]\n@Mike L - I omitted the use case for manually entering STATIC date between brackets. Good call? If not, I suggest making it a separate section to avoid cluttering this section.\nMike's Response:\nClick time variable (e.g.,\n$ReportDateTime$\n). If the panel below does not open, click\nOpen Date Format Macros\n. (A)\nTo use the above customized\ndate/time macros\n, proceed as follows. These macros support additional flexibility to date/time-based path names/filenames.\nStart here (e.g., for\n$ReportDateTime$\nvariable).\nTo insert macro within brackets, click symbols (e.g.,\n%Y\n)\n>\nNOTE\n- To return to main variable list, click\nOpen General Variables\n.\nRepeat step\nb\nas needed.\n(OPTIONAL): Inside brackets, add delimiters as needed. We strongly recommend dashes (e.g.,\n09-20-2023\n).\n(OPTIONAL): Outside brackets, insert prefix before macros and/or suffix after macros). (e.g.,\nTestReport09-20-2023\n, or\n09-20-2023_Daily\n)\nReturn to\nscheduling report\n.\nPRO TIP\nYou can create a directory path structure and filenames based on date/timestamps per the below example. We use\nMMDDYYYY\nfor the date and\nHHMM\nfor the time.\nDirectory:\nReports/09202023\nFilename:\nTest\n1002\nFilename:\nTest1853\nDirectory:\nReports/09202023\nFilename:\nTest\n0857\nFilename:\nTest1234\nCustom Keys\nCustom keys/variables provide a convenient way to define your report file path or filename in alignment with specific naming conventions. They correspond to custom fields (e.g.,\nIndication\n) defined at\ncampaign\n,\nline-item\n, or\ntactic\nlevel for this account. (e.g.,\n$Key[\nIndication\n]$\n).\nREQUIRED\nIf you select (e.g.) a campaign-level field:\nYou must be filtering on a specific campaign.\nThis custom field for that campaign must contain data.\nProceed as follows for paths and filenames:\nClick keys to include. The\nvalue\nof the custom key for the campaign in question (e.g.,\nTest123\n) will be included in path or filename.\nEdit path or filename as needed (e.g., add prefix and/or suffix).\nHybrid Paths/Filenames\nYou can combine different types of variables when creating a path or filename. The example below shows a path consisting of general variables (yellow highlights) and time variables (orange highlights).\nNOTE\nYou may need to click the\nicon to redisplay the variables.\nAdd Custom Destination\nYou can add your own custom destination for report delivery.\nNOTE\nClick\nhere\nto edit a custom destination.\nPrivate notes [9/21/23 SK]\n@Mike L - Please check the \"IMPORTANT\" note under step 5.

PLEASE DO NOT SHARE\n***********************************************************\nStarting a list of questions that we need to answer\n[3/23/23] SK - Imported from Google Docs via converting to Word Doc and uploading\nOverview\nWhat is HCP365?\nWhat can HCP365 do for my brand that a script lift cannot?\nWhat is the difference between HCP365 and NPI Reporting?\nHow do I access HCP365?\nHow much do you charge?\nWhere can I deploy HCP 365?\nAre there any limitations to where I can deploy HCP365?\nDeliverables\nWhat does the report/ deliverable look like?\nWhat does the report include?\nHow often will I receive a report?\nCan I customize my report/dashboard?\nData\nHow do you verify the Digital ID to NPI connection (methodology)?\nHow do you ensure user privacy when connecting an NPI to a digital ID?\nIs HCP365 built on 3rd party cookies?\n(old) We're connected into various identity resolution solutions in the market today, which allows us to identify, measure and target HCPs without using third party cookies. We started building our own HCP identity graph and doing first party publisher data partnerships a few years ago in anticipation of the Google move. So looking ahead, while there'll be some impact to everyone in the ad tech ecosystem, here at PulsePoint, we don't expect that impact to be significant.\nIs the data within Programmatic and Search Impression only, then within site is where we can find clicks? Is that correct?\nProgrammatic pixel fires on impressions, the search pixel fires on paid search clicks, and the site pixel fires on page views. For site, in the utm parameters, you can see what traffic drove the user to the site (i.e. search, display, social etc).\nWhat will this look like in 2023? (how the google cookie crumbles)\nWhy are the event/pixel fire totals lower in GA/SA360 vs. HCP365?\nWhat metric are the pixels based on for Search, Site, and Display?\nSearch = based on paid search click\nSite = page views / impression based\nMedia = impression based; pixel will fire based on the impression served\nWhy is page URL not available for Search?\nWhy is page URL not available for Media?\nWe are getting caught up on the difference between “is hcp” and “npi” data. Are you able to provide us a with a quick description of both columns?\nComparing the HCPs identified on HCP365 against our target list, the match rate was very low (0-5%). Is this common? What is the reason? Can you explain your methodology?\n[Answer] I’m not sure what different marketing strategies you have so I can’t speak to why certain HCPs are or are not visiting the site unfortunately. Except to say that it’s not uncommon for our partners to be surprised by who is actually engaging with their content. The DirectMatch database combines NPI to digital mappings from a number of highly vetted sources before going through what we lovingly call The Machine, which evaluates all digital signals for that NPI including how many sources concur, and then produces the final mapping output. The result is a confident database of NPI to digital ID. When the HCP365 pixel fires, we’re looking for an identifier on that user that we already have mapped to an NPI.\nOperations\nHow do I get started?\nWhere should I deploy the tags?\nWhat do I need to provide to get started?\nCan I use the HCP365 tag on other DSPs?",

For questions, please contact your Platform Solutions Manager at\nlifesupport@pulsepoint.com\n.\nAttribute Sublists for NPI Target Lists\nNPI sublist creation based on the metadata of a master NPI list is now available, making NPI list set up more actionable. How it works:\nUpload an NPI list with attributes.\nOnce uploaded, set up rules for filters to create sublists based on NPIs attributes, allowing the attributes to become a trigger for the creation of various sublists.\nSublists can be used in targeting just like any other NPI target list.\nTargeting Templates for Frequently Used Tactics\nTargeting templates allow users to templatize and quickly add all frequently used tactics, saving users time and improving accuracy during campaign set up. Templates are based off of the line item as different targeting tactics are usually applied per line item. Some of the most common use cases for frequently used tactics include Double Verify, Geo, Media supply and Exclusion lists.\nCustom Fields on Tactic Level\nCustom fields are now available on all levels of campaigns with the introduction of tactic fields on the tactic level.\nIncreased Number of NPI Lists Available for Reporting Templates\nUsers can now include up to 20 NPI lists for reporting\ntemplates.",

PLEASE DO NOT SHARE\n***********************************************************\nxxx\nSummary\nNOTE\nTo activate this feature, please contact your Platform Solutions Manager at\nlifesupport@pulsepoint.com\n.\nPulsePoint has launched a DTC measurement partnership with\nKomodo\n. It allows clients to enable in-platform DTC measurement powered by Komodo's Prism platform. We support three tiers of DTC measurement at different prices, which are applied to your CPM.\nPlease contact your Platform Solutions Manager at\nlifesupport@pulsepoint.com\nto enable this feature.\nTier 1:\nQualified Audience Reach (QAR) - Enabled for all Komodo users.\nTier 2:\nTrend Analytics - Please contact your Platform Solutions Manager at\nlifesupport@pulsepoint.com\nto activate for an additional fee.\nTier 3:\nFull View Script Lift - Please contact your Platform Solutions Manager at\nlifesupport@pulsepoint.com\nto activate for an additional fee.\nIMPORTANT\nKomodo's data enables PulsePoint to identify patients who\nactually have a diagnosed condition\n, rather than inferring the same from people's internet behavior.\nThis feature consists of the following components:\nCampaign Page:\nDetails\nTab: Define cohorts with their Id and name. (INTERNAL ONLY)\nDashboard\nTab: ???\nLine Item Page:\nDetails\nTab: Select one of cohorts defined at campaign level and specify which tier.\nOverview\nTab:\nTier 1: Graphs displaying QAR over a time period from PulsePoint data.\nTier 2, Tier 3: Links to Komodo data.\nTerminology\nQAR\n- Qualified Audience Reach. Percent of people exposed to your campaign who have the qualifying condition.\nCohort\n- Group of people you want to expose to your campaign.\nEXAMPLES\n-\nPeople with Type 2 Diabetes.\nPeople with Restless Leg Syndrome.\nCampaign Page\nNOTE\nThis functionality is visible only to PP people.\nYou can define cohorts for a campaign.\nEnter Cohort Id.\nSelect either:\n>\nIndividual\n-Number of humans exposed to campaign.\n>\nHousehold\n- Number of households exposed to campaign.

      "content": "GENERAL QUESTIONS\nClient Question:\nCan you please provide a list of the information that we’ll receive in the dashboard for HCP vs DTC campaigns so we can understand and potential privacy issues\nPulsePoint Response:\nFor campaigns targeting healthcare providers:\nPublicly available information about the NPIs being reached such as First Name, Last Name, National Provider Identification Number is available in reporting only. Access to reporting with 1:1 \"Physician Level Data\" can be turned on/off for specific users and campaigns and reports can be set up to only be available to specific users and delivered directly to a secure destination as needed.\nOther media metrics tied to the delivered media such as impressions, clicks, conversions, geography, device type, browser, operating system, domain, app, are all available at a 1:1 Physician level in reports.\nAggregated claims data such as #of HCPs reached prescribing a specific drug is also available in the dashboard\nFor campaigns targeting non-public professionals and consumers:\nAggregated media performance metrics such as impressions, uniques, clicks, conversions, geography, device type, browser, operating system, domain, app, are all available in aggregated form.\nNo personally identifiable information is available in any dashboard or report front end or backend.\nAll audience targeting is done via aggregated, anonymized, audience segments with a total count of unique devices for each segment being available.\nPOINT OF CARE TARGETING\nClient Question:\nWe were reviewing recent daily reports and noticed that they now contain NPI numbers along with NPI Name and Specialty for DTC campaigns with POC NPI targeting. Why are NPI’s being targeted in a DTC campaign?\nPulsePoint Response:\nThis change was made to allow for clients to tie back POC impressions to actual NPIs on their target list. Because POC locations and populations utilize NPI lists to facilitate the targeting, the numbers are included in PLDR. These impression figures can be interpreted as patients corresponding to X NPI as the individual served was mapped geographically to the POC location.\nInternal Note:\nOnly PP users have access to these details in reports (aka this info won’t populate if non-admin users generate reports in report builder). If a PP admin is to create/schedule a report, even if it’s to external users/an SFTP, it will populate this information.\nREACH\nClient Question:\nCan you share how PulsePoint reports on reach for both HCP & DTC campaigns? Is it based only on cookie data and device ID?\nPulsePoint Response:\nHere's our\nofficial FAQ\nwith more details on our stance and the solutions we're putting in place to ensure scale remains intact in a post cookie world. As cookies go away, reporting will not be impacted as we are still identifying, targeting, and serving impressions to every user on a unique device level, regardless of the identifier (cookie or otherwise) used to serve an impression.\nHCP Solutions: PulsePoint reaches and reports on HCPs on a 1:1 basis (Per \"Person). Our full cross device graph, powered by our\nAuthenticated NPI solution\nis leveraged to reach HCPs and is not reliant on cookies so we don't expect to see an impact in HCP reach from cookie deprecation.\nDTC Solutions: On the DTC side, reach results are anonymized and we report on reach via a count of unique devices reached. We map all DTC audiences to our proprietary cross device graph including IP addresses in order to avoid the impacts of cookie deprecation but we do expect to see some impact in reach when cookie based audiences are used for targeting purposes. We are actively engaged in supporting 3rd party cookieless identity solutions via partnerships with Liveramp, Neustar, Lotame, and BritePool to ensure any impact in reach against 3rd party datasets is minimal and it's important to note that we also have an entire suite of 1st party contextual and claims based audience segments available today that don't rely on cookies.\nAD CHOICE LOGO\nClient Question:\nCan you provide me with some guidance on best practices for enabling AdChoices, including the recommended position to select for the creatives.\nPulsePoint Response:\nConfirming that the usage of an Ad Choices logo is required when you are using behavioral-based targeting, I.E. non-contextual. That said, we generally recommend using it across the board in order to avoid any possible mishaps. Importantly, PulsePoint covers the CPM so there are no fiscal concerns with essentially being the most safe as possible.\nFor its placement, I’d say nearly every client places the logo in the upper right corner of the creative - this placement is generally the least intrusive.\nPIXELS\nClient Question:\nDo we need to provide a landing page URL when requesting pixels? (We have some actions that do not necessarily have a URL, ex. Hitting “submit” at the end of a form)\nPulsePoint Response:\nWe are able to generate conversion pixels without landing page URLs. However, if possible, we recommend having URLs with the actions or would at least appreciate more information on where and how the pixels are placed once they are implemented. We need this information so that we can verify and test that the pixels are placed and firing correctly.\nCONVERSIONS\nClient Question:\nIt looks like we have a healthy engagement through clicks, but unfortunately they are not leading to enrollments. Is there anything we can do to drive enrollments?\nPulsePoint Response:\nAs you noted, we have been delivering a healthy increasing CTR week over week. However, because the main goal of this campaign is to drive enrollments, we would recommend shifting our focus to optimize towards delivery on desktop. While mobile can be a great driver of clicks and traffic, desktop is typically more adept at driving conversions, form fills and longer term engagements. One caveat is that when we move our focus to desktop we may see a decrease in CTR as a tradeoff, but as a result have more quality traffic and increased likelihood for enrollments. After the change has been implemented, we recommend monitoring the campaign’s performance for the next 3-4 weeks.\nAlso - since there are limitations with placing pixels to track enrollments, would it be possible to share automated weekly Google Analytics reports to adopsreporting@pulsepoint.com for our campaign? The GA reports will help us see how we are trending and better inform us on our optimizations.\nLastly, when looking at PulsePoint from the standpoint of view-through or assisted conversions, we would highly recommend having your search and social channels running in tandem with our campaign.  Because search and social are more lower funnel in nature, having these channels implemented will help to capitalize on the qualified traffic that programmatic is driving and in-turn push these individuals further down the funnel to enroll.",

Request comes into Medscape for a programmatic guaranteed campaign to be setup within the Medscape Exchange, allowing the advertiser to purchase this inventory through their DSP account within Life.\n2. Direct Rep creates a SF opportunity and works with MS on avails and Planning on reservation. It’s important for the rep to specify that this is a PG deal within the opportunity by selecting the “Medscape Exchange | PulsePoint Platform Activation | PG ” deliverable. *Note, Medscape Exchange PG deals are handled just like TL Direct deals in terms of understanding avails/config and reservation of media.\n3. Sales confirms TL config/budget to be used with Customer. Customer approves plan and intent to move forward via email, media plan (CMI), or insertion order.\n4. Sales request Media Reservation to be completed by Planner in AdBook. Planner reserves the order. This acts just as an Order Management placeholder for Medscape. Set up and creation of program is handled in PulsePoint.\n5. Sales moves opportunity to pending. Again, ensuring that the correct deliverable name is selected (Medscape Exchange | PulsePoint Platform Activation | PG).\n6. Sales Ops processes PPW and communicates to business (communications sent out to AdBook, paperwork received automated emails also sent via SF)\n7. Sales Planning submits deal information into Google doc:\nhttps://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gneppao0UnC5T8xkP5ap2boiruKRe-_FjL_2qnT8iIw/edit#gid=0\nEach Medscape Exchange Programmatic Guaranteed Deal lives in here.\nTo setup the order, the programmatic team needs the following information:\nSF#\nPharma Company\nBrand\nTotal Cost\nCPM\nTotal Impressions\nRun Dates\nAd Sizes - if available\nAdvertiser’s Account ID and Advertiser ID within Pulsepoint’s Life Platform\nEmail Address for all planners and sales contacts that would need to receive automated reports\n8. Sales Planner notifies Giorgi, Zaire, and Joe via email that plan details have been entered into doc and include the Target List file that is being used.

      "content": "EXTERNAL DTC Insights User Guide & FAQ\nUser Guide\nRequired DTC Insights Criteria\n:\nFollowing these guidelines will provide the most effective DTC campaign reporting.\nUser specific criteria\n:\nOnly self-service and self-service+ users can access Tier 1 Qualified Audience Reach scores in Life\n.\nSelf-service, self-service+ and managed service users can access Tier 2 Trend Analytics and Tier 3 Full-View Script Lift dashboards in Komodo with a separate Komodo login.\nNote: No manual reporting will be provided for Managed service users. They must login to Komodo to access reports.\nCampaign specific criteria\n:\nDTC\nOnly:\nQualified Audience Reach scores in Life and Komodo dashboards are available for DTC campaigns only.\nLive campaigns only:\nA DTC campaign must be live to measure results. DTC Insights will only measure campaign data once it’s configured for a current and or new campaign.\nTier 1 -\nQualified Audience Reach\nValidate intended audiences reached through daily Qualified Audience Reach scores.\nQualified Audience Reach Scores in Life:\nDescription:\nQualified Audience Reach (QAR) scores provide daily visibility into the % of intended audiences exposed as defined by the brand and qualified by diagnosed patient pools from Komodo’s Healthcare Map.\nQAR is calculated by the # of exposed patients who have the condition of interest divided by the # of total exposed patients.\nQAR scores are broken down by the following elements:\nLine item\nFlight\nTactic\nThe Qualified Audience Reach score tab is visible by line item in Overview metrics in Life. The top AQ score shown in the tab is the average score of all tactics in a line item combined.\nFunction:\nUsers can validate DTC campaign reach and targeting strategy accuracy.\nAvailable filters:\nQualified Audience Reach\nmeasures can be filtered by line item and tactic.\nUsers can choose to view scores as a cumulative measure or start at zero. The default is both.\nCumulative QAR is an additive metric that shows QAR for a given line item or tactic over time.\nThe adjacent Komodo logo links to the client’s external Tier 2 and Tier 3 Komodo dashboards (explained in detail under Frequently Asked Questions below). If Tier 2 and 3 dashboards are not enabled, the Komodo logo has no link.\nData refresh:\nOnce a campaign is live, Qualified Audience Reach metrics will be visible 2 days post-launch. Users will see a message in-platform indicating when Qualified Audience Reach is turned on but needs time to ramp up.\nDuring a campaign, metrics are updated daily.\nA minimum of 100 exposed individuals who fall within a cohort in a given time period is needed for QAR scores to populate. A QAR score of 0 indicates that the campaign did not reach at least 100 exposed individuals who fell within the cohort in a given time period.  A daily QAR may never reach 100+, but the moving 7-day QAR or cumulative QAR likely will.\nTier 2 -\nTrend Analytics\nIdentify campaign-driven peaks in weekly Dx, Rx and Tx trends for exposed audiences and drill into high-performing channels, ad frequency and demographics. Trend Analytics i\nncludes enhanced Qualified Audience Reach Scores, Source of Business, Audience Profiling and Measurement & Efficiency dashboards.\nQualified Audience Reach Scores within Komodo:\nDescription:\nIn addition to Qualified Audience Reach scores in Life, DTC Trend Analytics offers enhanced weekly scoring in Komodo, including diagnosis and conversion rates post-exposure.\nQualified Audience Reach definitions:\nQualified Audience Reach Weekly Average\n:\nweekly scoring of the % of intended audiences reached throughout DTC campaigns\nQualified Audience Reach Longer Term Trends:\na daily AQ, 7 day look back and upper and lower bounds metrics to detect outliers when comparing targeting strategy efficacy over time\nQualified Audience Reach by Line Item Type:\nweekly\nAQ scoring for channel efficacy by intended diagnosis over time\nTotal Individuals Exposed\n:\na count of all individuals exposed, not uniques\nTotal Diagnosed Individuals from Exposed Population:\na count of all individuals exposed (not uniques) with the target diagnosis\nHeart Failure was the target diagnosis example in the demo screenshot above\nby Target Diagnosis Status at First Exposure\n:\npercentages of all individuals exposed with the target diagnosis at first exposure to an ad. Percentages are grouped by diagnosis severity: general, severe or none\nHeart Failure was the target diagnosis example in the demo screenshot above\nby Conversion Status\n:\npercentages of intended individuals exposed who converted to the target therapy after seeing an ad\nData refresh:\nOnce a campaign is live, metrics will be visible a week post-launch.\nDuring a campaign, metrics are updated weekly\n.\nAudience Profiling:\nDTC Trend Analytics’ Audience Profiling dashboard gives weekly\nvisibility into exposure trends and demographics for exposed individuals.\nFunction:\nUsers can improve audience quality mid-flight by tailoring campaigns to\nRx engaged audience demographics such as location, gender and age.\nAudience Profiling Definitions:\nTotal Unique Individuals Exposed Over Time\n:\ntracks unique individuals exposed cumulatively over the total flight\nTotal Individuals Exposed by Month:\ntracks all individuals exposed; not uniques\nTotal Unique Individuals Exposed by Month\n:\ntracks unique individuals exposed\nCampaign Target Demographics\n:\ndemographic info by state location, gender and age for individuals exposed\nAddition of these analytics would require a change in pricing at the contract level\nConversion Demographics\n:\ndemographic info by state location, gender and age for individuals exposed who started a new target Rx after seeing an ad\nAddition of these analytics would require a change in pricing at the contract level\nData refresh:\nOnce a campaign is live, metrics will be visible a week post-launch.\nDuring a campaign, metrics are updated weekly.\nSource of Business:\nDescription:\nDTC Trend Trend Analytics’ Source of Business dashboard gives monthly visibility into patient Rx and Tx behavior, with both target and competitor scripts, for cohorts of exposed audiences 12 months post-exposure.\nIt is titled “Source of Business” because the report provides insight into where new business (new prescriptions) is coming from, e.g. is it entirely new-to-brand or are patients switching from competitors?\nFunction:\nCampaign influence on script and treatment performance trends is measured through brand sources of business including new script fills, refills and restarts after discontinues.\nBrands can accredit script lifts and drops to specific campaign tactics and optimize strategy mid-flight to increase script starts and improve treatment adherence.\nIf you sort the SoB report by temporal cohort (second column from left), you can see the change in Rx status over time for a particular cohort of patients who were first exposed during a particular month. For example, if I have a campaign for insulin A and my campaign strategy is to steal share from insulin B, then I can assess the impact of the advertising in driving NBRx and see where this is coming from. Was the patient treatment naïve or, were they previously on insulin B prior to exposure and then switched to insulin A post exposure?\nSource of Business Definitions:\nFull SoB Report:\nclinical behavior counts based on monthly cohorts of intended audiences exposed\nNo therapy\n:\nexposed individuals not filling target or competitor Rx\nDiscontinued\n: patients who discontinued target or competitor Rx for at least 30 days\nNBRx\n:\npatients who just started the target Rx, who are maintaining the Rx, and who restarted the Rx after a +12 mo hiatus\nRestarted\n: patients who restarted the Rx within the past 12 mo\nRefilled\n: patients who refilled the Rx\nOn therapy\n: patients who are adhering to the Rx\nNon-adherent\n: patients who discontinued target Rx within the last 30 days\nOn competitor\n: patients on competitor Rx\nSwitch from\n: patients who switched from competitor Rx to target Rx (competitive conquest)\nSwitch to\n: patients who switched to competitor Rx from target Rx\nOn Therapy Distribution for Current Month Across all Cohorts\n:\na clinical behavior bar chart visual across all cohorts during the current month\nCumulative Conversion and Persistence Metrics Over Campaign Across All Cohorts\n:\na clinical behavior line graph visual across all cohorts during the entire campaign, updated weekly\nData refresh:\nOnce a campaign is live, metrics will be visible a month post-launch.\nDuring a campaign, metrics are updated monthly.\nMeasurement & Efficiency:\nDescription:\nDTC Trend Analytics’ Measurement & Efficiency dashboard gives weekly visibility into ad frequency's effect on brand conversion.\nFunction:\nUsers can improve conversion rates mid-flight by tailoring ad frequency to higher engagement trends.\nConversion Definitions:\nConversion by Temporal Cohort:\nmeasures cohorts of individuals with new prescriptions from the month that each cohort was exposed\nConversion by Temporal Cohort (Time Aligned):\nmeasures cohorts of individuals with new prescriptions from the start of each campaign regardless of the calendar month\nTotal Exposed by Frequency:\nmeasures ad frequency and individuals exposed\nTotal Conversion by Frequency:\nmeasures ad frequency and individuals with new prescriptions post-exposure\nConversion Rate by Frequency:\nmeasures ad frequency and conversion rates for individuals with new prescriptions post-exposure\nData refresh:\nOnce a campaign is live, metrics will be visible a week post-launch.\nDuring a campaign, metrics are updated weekly.\nTier 3 -\nFull-View Script Lift\nCompare target therapy conversions for exposed and unexposed patient segments on a monthly basis with advanced test and control methodologies.\nIncluding Trend Analytics’ Qualified Audience Reach Scores, Source of Business, and Audience Profiling dashboards PLUS Segmentation & Treatment Journey and enhanced Measurement & Efficiency dashboards.\nSegmentation & Treatment Journey:\nDescription:\nDTC Full-View Script Lift’s Segmentation & Treatment Journey dashboard gives monthly visibility into test and control analyses for clinical behavior post-exposure by individuals exposed (campaign) and unexposed (control) based on Komodo’s Healthcare Map.\nFunction:\nUsers gain deep insight into patient journeys 12/mo post-exposure and can optimize campaign strategy mid-flight to increase specialist visits, diagnoses, new target prescriptions and competitive conquesting.\nSegmentation & Treatment Journey Definitions:\nPost-Exposure Reaction\n: a test and control analysis of the clinical events of all individuals exposed by intended individuals exposed (campaign) and unexposed (control).\nUsers define patient journey reactions based on their brand attributes\nUsers may also filter the data by target diagnosis status at exposure\nPercent with Any Reaction\n:\nthe total percentage of reactions for intended individuals exposed (campaign) and unexposed (control)\nCampaign Lift by Exposure Reaction\n:\nmeasures lift and/ or drops in patient reactions for intended individuals exposed (campaign) and unexposed (control)\nPayer Mix of Exposed Population:\nmeasures the various payer types that reimbursed\nindividuals exposed for target treatment, e.g. medical/ drug claims\nPayer Mix of Individuals with New Prescriptions:\nmeasures the various payer types that reimbursed individuals exposed with new target prescriptions\nSite of Care for New Prescriptions:\nmeasures the type of facility associated with the prescribing HCP for intended individuals exposed with new target prescriptions\nNew Competitor Prescriptions Post-Exposure:\nmeasures new competitor prescriptions versus new target prescriptions post-exposure for intended individuals exposed (campaign) and unexposed (control)\nThis graph displays the amount of individuals that received Rx for the client's defined 'Competitor(s)' following their initial exposure to the campaign, compared to a Control group. Generally, the insights in this chart should prompt a larger conversation around conversion, strategy, and optimization. The additional charts/insights within the Dashboard can help to reveal more context behind what the client sees in “New Competitor Prescriptions Post-Exposure” You wouldn’t necessarily know if drug switches are taking place from this graph alone, however SoB would give more visibility into drug switching/newly prescribed patients.\nSpecialist Appointments in Year Post-Engagement (Campaign):\nthe percentage of individuals exposed (campaign) who did or did not see a specialist in the year after seeing an ad\nSpecialist Appointments in Year Post-Engagement (Control)\n:\nthe percentage of individuals unexposed (control) who did or did not see a specialist in the year after seeing an ad\nFirst Specialist Seen in the Year Post-Engagement:\na test and control analysis of the various types of first specialists seen by intended individuals exposed (campaign) and unexposed (control) in the year after seeing an ad. Users define specialists based on their brand attributes\nData refresh:\nOnce a campaign is live, metrics will be visible a month post-launch.\nDuring a campaign, metrics are updated monthly\nMeasurement & Efficiency enhanced\n:\nDescription:\nDTC Full-View Script Lift’s Measurement & Efficiency dashboard gives monthly visibility into test and control analyses for conversion rates (e.g. script lift) post-exposure by individuals exposed (campaign) and unexposed (control) based on Komodo’s Healthcare Map.\nFunction:\nUsers can accredit script lift to specific campaigns, channels and monthly timelines to discover direct and indirect campaign influences and improve conversion rates.\nMeasurement & Efficiency Definitions:\nTotal Individuals Reached\n: a total count of the audience reached\nPopulation with New Prescription Post Exposure\n:\na test and control count of new prescriptions, scripts due to switches from and scripts due to restarts post-exposure by intended individuals exposed (campaign) and unexposed (control)\nPercent of Population with New Prescription Post Exposure\n:\na test and control percentage of new prescriptions post-exposure by intended individuals exposed (campaign) and unexposed (control)\nTotal Exposed by Frequency\n:\nmeasures ad frequency and individuals exposed\nTotal Conversion by Frequency\n:\nmeasures ad frequency and individuals with new prescriptions post-exposure\nConversion Rate by Frequency\n:\nmeasures ad frequency and conversion rates for individuals with new prescriptions post-exposure\nConversion by Temporal Cohort\n:\nmeasures cohorts of individuals with new prescriptions from the month that each cohort was exposed\nConversion by Temporal Cohort (Time Aligned\n):\nmeasures cohorts of individuals with new prescriptions from the start of each campaign regardless of the calendar month\nCumulative Conversion vs. Randomized Control Population\nOverall Cumulative Conversion (Time Aligned)\n:\na test and control analysis of cohorts of individuals with new prescriptions by the cumulative intended individuals exposed (campaign) and unexposed (control) from the start of each campaign regardless of the calendar month\nCumulative Conversion - Sep 2021 Cohort\n:\na test and control analysis of cohorts of individuals with new prescriptions by intended individuals exposed (campaign) and unexposed (control) from the month that each cohort was exposed\nSummary of Campaign Performance\n:\na comprehensive overview of campaign performance by channel type, cost, reach, expected revenue, ROI and more, updated quarterly\nLine Item Type\n: the tactics used in a campaign by line item which is pulled directly from Life\nProperty cost\n: campaign expenses by line item\nWeighted contribution\n: a percentage of probability that a line item drove conversions\nKomodo uses Markov Chain attribution model which estimates the marginal contribution of each channel by calculating the probability that conversion occurs as a function of the multitude of exposure pathways, taking into account the order of channel exposure\nGross attributed individuals\n:\na count of all exposed individuals who converted by line item, calculated by multiplying Weighted contribution and Gross Conversion Count in Exposed Population\nNet attributed individuals\n: a count of all exposed individuals who converted by line item, minus unexposed individuals with new prescriptions in the control group, calculated by multiplying Weighted contribution and Net Conversion Count\nUnexposed individuals in the control group are counted because they may start the target therapy naturally during the campaign time frame, without having ever seen an ad\nNote that Net calculations may not always show positive ROI and in fact show negative ROI in cases where brands may not be targeting the right audience demographics. Clients should be encouraged to revise targeting criteria, such as adding more resources to high performing  audience demographics and channels\nNet expected revenue\n: expected revenue for every line item calculated by the number of Net attributed individuals multiplied by customer lifetime value\nNet cost per NPS\n: cost per NPS (new patient starts) for every line item calculated by the Property cost per line item divided by the number of net attributed individuals\nNet ROI\n: return on investment percentage calculated by the Net expected revenue divided by the Property cost per line item\nNet ROI ratio\n: a numerical representation of Net ROI\nP-value\n:\na statistical test evaluating a line item’s effect on conversion. P-values less than 0.05 are considered statistically significant which indicates that there is a low likelihood of results occurring naturally without campaign influence, and therefore, higher Net ROI.\nMethodology\n: For each campaign, Komodo dollarizes the impact of the media spend by multiplying the projected number of patients who converted (or other primary endpoint) by the expected \"lifetime value\" per patient.  For multi-channel campaigns, the projected number of patients who converted is estimated by running a Markov attribution algorithm which isolates the impact of each channel's spend regardless of how that channel was/was not used in combination with other channels. ROI is then calculated by dividing the expected total revenue by the media spend per channel\nGross Conversion Count in Exposed Population\n:\na count of exposed individuals with new prescriptions, updated quarterly\nNet Conversion Count\n:\na count of exposed individuals with new prescriptions, minus unexposed individuals with new prescriptions in the control group, updated quarterly\nUnexposed individuals in the control group are counted because they may start the target therapy naturally during the campaign time frame, without having ever seen an ad\nNote that Net calculations may not always show positive ROI and in fact show negative ROI in cases where brands may not be targeting the right audience demographics. Clients should be encouraged to revise targeting criteria, such as adding more resources to high performing audience demographics and channels\nReach Summary\n:\nreach metrics by line item type, updated quarterly\nUnique Individuals\n: unique individuals reached by line item type\nUnique Diagnosed Individuals\n:\nunique individuals reached with the target diagnosis by line item type\n% Diagnosed\n: the percentage of Unique Individuals reached with the target diagnosis  by line item type\nCampaign Efficiency\n:\nan audience quality analysis for every line item calculated by % Diagnosed divided by Property cost, updated quarterly\nIn this bubble graph view, the bigger the bubble, the greater the reach. Big bubbles  close to the top of the y-axis and close to the left on the x-axis imply high reach and high audience quality achieved at low cost\nAvailable filters:\nResults can be filtered by age, gender, or disease severity, which users define based on the brand\nData refresh:\nOnce a campaign is live, metrics will be visible a month post-launch.\nDuring a campaign, metrics are updated monthly.\nFAQ\nGeneral\nQ: Are these measurements available for HCP campaigns?\nA\n:\nNo, DTC only. The Qualified Audience Reach tab will not be visible in HCP campaign metrics.\nQ: Are these measurements available for all programmatic media or just Life media?\nA\n:\nLife media only.\nQ: Where on the dashboards are the cohorts outlined\nA\n:\nCohort Condition of interest is visible above the chart tabs as a sub-header, for example “Prostate Cancer” featured below. In the Filter tab on the left, users can select cohorts by first month exposed and filter by age, gender, etc.\nTier setup/ switch, RFPs\nQ: What is required in order for Qualified Audience Reach Tier 1 to be set up?\nA\n:\nWithin inactive QAR score tabs in line item metrics dashboards, users will see descriptions for each DTC Insights tier and instructions to contact their Account Manager (AM) to set up the desired tier.\nBased on a client’s request, AMs then enable measurement.\nWorking with account executives to gather cohort information\n, AMs will provide a list of condition cohorts for a client to choose from. Once chosen, AMs will enable cohort measurement for the appropriate tier, making QAR scores available in line item metrics dashboards.\nOnce a campaign is live, Qualified Audience Reach metrics will be visible a few days post-launch. Users will see a message in-platform indicating when Qualified Audience Reach is turned on, but needs time to ramp up. A minimum of 100 exposed individuals who fall within a cohort in a given time period is needed for QAR scores to populate. A QAR score of 0 indicates that the campaign did not reach at least 100 exposed individuals who fell within the cohort in a given time period.  A daily QAR may never reach 100+, but the moving 7-day QAR or cumulative QAR likely will.\nQ: What is required on PulsePoint’s side to set up Tier 2 or 3 post-sale?\nA\n:\nBased on a client’s request, AMs will submit a Komodo intake form with Tier 2 or 3 selected based on specific questions. Working with account executives to gather cohort information\n, AMs will then provide a list of condition cohorts for a client to choose from. Once chosen, AMs will enable cohort measurement for the appropriate tier, making QAR scores available in line item metrics dashboards.\nOnce enabled, measurement and billing will begin upon campaign launch.\nUsers can access Tier 2 or 3 dashboards outside of Life through custom dashboards in Komodo’s platform.\nQ: What is the process for switching tiers mid campaign?\nA\n:\nTiers can be upgraded but cannot be downgraded. In short, we would treat any upgrade as a new campaign.\nPlease submit an intake form for the upgraded tier request according to the agreed upon SLAs. You will receive a new dashboard for the upgraded tier on the 1st of the month due to CPM changes and measurement read out.\nIf you’d like to capture the retroactive data from the lower tier in the upgraded tier, there may be additional cost. Your sales rep can reach out to Komodo partners to discuss pricing.\nQ: If you sign up for Full-View Script Lift Tier 3 does this also give you visibility to Trends Analytics Tier 2 and Qualified Audience Reach Tier 1 dashboards too? If you sign up for Trends Analytics Tier 2 does this also give you visibility to the Qualified Audience Reach Tier 1 dashboard?\nA\n:\nYes\nData refresh, lag\nQ: What is implementation time from requesting access to Tier 1, 2 or 3 and getting visibility to results?\nA\n:\nQualified Audience Reach scores will be visible approximately five business days after proper intake form submission with all required client data and other client /market-related inputs. For Trend Analytics Tier 2, the dashboards will go live about 15 days after proper intake form submission. For Full-View Script Lift Tier 3, data is delivered on a monthly basis, and thus the required customer data to begin delivery would be a month’s worth of data after proper intake form submission.\nQ: How often are the charts refreshed post implementation?\nA\n:\nCharts are updated daily for Qualified Audience Reach, weekly for Trend Analytics and monthly for Full-View Script Lift. Weekly metrics will be refreshed on each Wednesday following delivery. Monthly metrics will be refreshed on the 3rd business day of each month following delivery. During monthly refreshes, weekly metrics will also be refreshed to keep everything consistent, so at the beginning of each month, you may have two refreshes within one week.\nQ: Will DTC Insights backtrack past campaign data?\nA\n:\nNo, DTC Insights will only measure campaign data once it’s configured for a new campaign.\nReporting\nQ: Will users have back end access for Tiers 2 and 3 and flexibility to do custom reporting?\nA\n:\nBackend access is not covered with the tiered PulsePoint offerings. If customers wish to expand their access, they can work directly with Komodo to contract for additional “backend” access to the joined data in a secure environment. Likewise, if custom reporting is desired, they can open a discussion with Komodo regarding scope, timing, and fees. Please reach out to your sales representative to be connected with our Komodo partners.\nQ: Does every user decide how frequently they want each report? Which do or don’t have flexibility in terms of data refresh and or reporting frequency?\nA\n:\nCustom report frequency and data refresh dates are not available at this time. Users must return to the dashboard to view updates.\nCompetitive differentiation\nQ: What differentiates Komodo’s clinical data?\nA\n:\nKomodo’s clinical data is 70% based on payer completes from Rx fills as a primary signal, rather than open claims as the major input which has 30-90-day delays from insurance payments as a primary signal.\nQ: What level of competitive insight will we have (alternative treatments considered)?\nA\n:\nClients will define the competitors to measure against during onboarding. Tier 2 & 3 give monthly visibility into patient therapy behavior, with both target and competitor scripts, for cohorts of exposed audiences 12 months post-exposure. Competitor metrics include: patients currently on competitor treatment, patients who switched from competitor treatment to target script, patients who switched to competitor treatment from target script, and comparisons between new competitor and target prescriptions post-exposure based on exposed and unexposed audiences within Tier 3 Full-View Script Lift’s Segmentation & Treatment Journey tab.\nChannel measurement, CTV\nQ: What channels can be measured, e.g. d\nisplay, video, native\nand CTV?\nA\n:\nClients can tag most channels utilized in Life that they want to track, except DOOH and audio. DTC Insights covers CTV, search, social, print, and\noffice, with a limit of up to 20 groupings.\nQ: Does Komodo provide visibility to multi-touch attribution?\nA\n:\nKomodo’s default is Markov Chain attribution for multi-channel campaigns and is the methodology used in Tier 3. The Markov approach is an iterative algorithm that creates a consumer “graph” (Markov chain) to map out not only the various combinations of channels that consumers are exposed to, but also the order and any potential channel “re-exposure loops” (e.g., site A > site B > site A > site C). The Markov approach estimates the marginal contribution of each channel by calculating the probability that conversion occurs as a function of the multitude of exposure pathways.\nClinical/ claims data\nQ: Does DTC Insights\nmeasure claims data beyond scripts, e.g. CPT codes, medical devices\n?\nA\n:\nClients can tag any clinical trigger they want to track, e.g. a med device's category or brand specific HCPCS, J-Code, NDC, Rx or CPT code. Exact codes can be provided upon request to your AM or PSM.\nQ: Can your platform measure buy-n-bills meds? How does your platform account for buy-n-bill meds?\nA\n:\nIf we consider that most buy and bill meds are SP drugs, due to the amount of sources of data Komodo partners with, we do have SP Rx capture, beyond what a typical aggregator would see. Moreso, on the Mx side than the Rx side. So if the drug is J-Coded (J-Codes primarily identify injectable drugs that ordinarily cannot be self-administered, chemotherapy drugs, and some orally administered drugs) we’ll likely have the heaviest capture as these are captured in Mx claims. We can easily leverage Prism to see capture on a drug by drug basis.\nFor buy and bill specifically, it's hard to tell directly but we can make inferences based on the pharmacy NPI. For example, if you saw an infusion drug at a pharmacy claim vs the medical claim side, it could be because of buy and bill since infusion drugs are usually on the Mx side.\nQ: Will the partnered solution address the complete patient journey, from Rx, specialty pharma, clinical, EHR/EMR, Payer, Lab, Hospital, HCPs, and HCOs?\nA\n:\nYes, with two exceptions: Komodo does not have\nEHR\n/EMR data and lab results would be an additional request/ fee. Data from all available sources is incorporated into all tiers. However, only Tier 3 will show more specific insights on the patient journey, regarding HCPs, payer, place of service, etc.\nQAR scores, codes, benchmarks\nQ: Can I customize the condition codes I want to measure QAR against? How can I know what ICD-10s QAR scores are measuring against?\nA\n:\nQAR in Life is an off the shelf cohort with no customization. Tier 2 and 3 QAR scores are customizable with\nclients providing desired ICD10 codes in intake forms.\nQ: What methodology was used to define which codes are applicable to which drugs? Can PP provide more insight as to how patient definitions are developed in cases where ICD10 is not cut & dry?\nA\n:\nOur methodology is based on Komodo’s Healthcare Map and AMs touch base with Komodo’s Clinical team for their recommendations on what the best ICD10 codes are for certain conditions (e.g. seasonal allergies or drug allergies).\nQ: What would be an anticipated range or benchmark for AQ scores that I could expect to see to ensure results are within the realm of normal or outperforming? What action should/could I take when I see below normal performance results?\nA\n:\nQualified Audience Reach scores are unique to every therapeutic area and the media plan for that specific campaign. There are no industry benchmarks to compare scores with, but rather a brand’s own high, low and average AQ scores throughout campaign lifecycles. Within Full-View Script Lift’s Conversion tab, users can compare campaign target demographics with subsequent Rx demographics for individuals that started Rx after exposure. These insights can be used to better define location, gender and age criteria to improve performance and AQ scores of current and future DTC campaigns.\nQ: Can I identify QAR scores (how many consumers are likely to be diagnosed) across various channels pre-campaign launch?\nA\n:\nNo. QAR scores (and all DTC Insights tiers) are only available post-campaign launch.\nQ: Can I see the cost to reach the diagnosed population and the cost to convert new patients pre-campaign launch?\nA\n:\nNo. We cannot provide QAR scores or audiences before campaign launch, so we cannot figure out the exact costs to reach those qualified audiences or convert new patients pre-launch.\nCompliance, deduping data, privacy\nQ: How does Komodo ensure HIPAA compliance, e.g. the process for de-id tokenization and linkage?\nA\n:\nKomodo collects de-identified data from a variety of different sources, primarily at the claim level, and they use a 3P service to tokenize. They have a token for every single patient regardless of what source they came from. Data is cleaned, normalized and de-duped while ensuring it can stitch together a longitudinal history for every single patient. Post normalization, it is linked back at the token level.\nQ: How does Komodo manage deduping of data?\nA\n:\nTo level set, ‘Patient’ is defined as individuals who receive healthcare services and/or products that trigger a Visit.

Its just 1 line which says – for any click which Pulsepoint identifies as invalid, we will append a parameter ppinv=1 at the end of the redirect and you can discard / reject such URLs in GA / Adobe reporting.\nHowever, if you check with Zach Rice, he might be able to tell you a few more FAQ style questions which people have asked and maybe we can add them up to make this meaty.\nE.g.

PulsePoint and the tag vendor both invalidate test clicks from these publishers. Unfortunately, these test clicks generate sessions in Google Analytics and Google Analytics does not invalid sessions that are derived from clicks that DCM and PulsePoint deem invalid.\nPulsePoint created an adjustment which will allow GA setups to invalidate sessions which we know have originated from test clicks.

Purposes\nPurpose 1 - Store and/or access information on a device\nNUMBER\n1\nName\nStore and/or access information on a device\nLegal text\nVendors can:\n● Store and access information on the device such as cookies and device identifiers for the purposes presented to a user.\nUser-friendly text\nCookies, device identifiers, or other information can be stored or accessed on your device for the purposes presented to you.\nVendor guidance\n● Allowable Lawful Basis: Consent.\n● Purpose 1 is meant to signal whether the condition for lawful storing and/or accessing information on a user’s device is met where this is required. It is not a purpose for personal data processing in itself, unlike all other Purposes the Framework covers. Purpose 1 corresponds to the obligation of Article 5(3) of the ePrivacy Directive. While Purpose 1 is not a data processing purpose, is technically treated the same way for signalling purposes.\n● Purpose 1 does not apply to processing identifiers or client information, etc. that is not accessed on a user device. For example, reading a device’s IDFA falls within Purpose 1, however processing an IDFA outside of reading it from a device, e.g. when receiving it as part of information sent through an ad request is not covered by Purpose 1.\n● If information stored or accessed falls within the information covered by Special Feature 2 or Feature 3, Vendors must make sure to adhere to the opt in requirement of Special Feature 2 and the disclosure requirement of Feature 3 respectively in addition to the consent requirement of Purpose 1.\n● Controllers may register for Purpose 1 only in conjunction with another Purpose, Feature, Special Purpose, and/or Special Feature. Any personal data stored and/or accessed via Purpose 1 still requires another Purpose to actually be processed.

PLEASE DO NOT SHARE\n***********************************************************\nIntroduction\nWhen you configure a scheduled report, you can specify custom destination(s) such as\nFTP, SFTP, S3, GCP.\nScheduling Custom Destination Report\nThese instructions presume you have\npopulated the upper portion of the above screen\n. Proceed as follows within the green outline.\nDeliver to:\nSelect\nCustom Destination\n.\nEvent-level Report:\nThese reports provide non-aggregated, data at our most granular level. This data is essentially raw log data that can include all available fields. Click checkbox to enable.\nDestination:\nDo either:\nSelect from destinations configured for this account such as\nFTP, SFTP, S3, GCP.\nClick\n. See\nhere\nfor info.\nML-SK:File Path:\nEnter path/folder (within your destination) where file should reside, delimited by forward slashes (\n/\n),\nwithout\na slash after last component. (Limit:\n235\ncharacters.)\n>\nPRIVATE NOTE -\n4/21/23 SK -\n(1) Should we mark the file path as OPTIONAL since you can specify path at custom destination level?\n(2) Please review bullet points below.\n(3) Manually insert a leading slash? I'm thinking NO b/c when you build a path with the macros a slash is not inserted at the beginning.\n>\nEXAMPLE\n-\nStephen/Reports/NPI\n>\nIMPORTANT\n- You must specify either a File Path or Destination Path (or both).\n>\nNOTE\n- If your\nspecified destination\nitself contains a path:\n>> The File Path will be appended (e.g.,\n<FTP Path>\n/\n<Report Path>\n).\n>> You can omit the File Path, in which case we use only the Destination Path.\n>\nNOTE\n- If you wish to apply macro(s) to path, click\nand\nselect macro(s)\n.\nFile Name:\nEnter unique name for destination file you will retrieve. (Limit:\n235\ncharacters.) (B)\n>\nNOTE\n- If you wish to apply macro(s) to filename, click\nand\nselect macro(s)\n.\nReport Format:\nSelect:\n>\nCSV\n(Comma-separated values)\n>\nTSV\n(Tab-separated values)\n>\nPipe-Delimited\n(Pipe-separated values, extension: .\nTXT\n)\n>>\nEXAMPLE\n-\n\"3\"|\"5\"\n>\nExcel\n(Extension:\n.XLSX\n)\nText Qualifier:\n(Ignore for\nExcel\nformat.) Normally, text fields in output file are enclosed in quotes. To remove them, uncheck checkbox.\n(OPTIONAL):\nArchivation:\nSelect how you wish to archive your file.\n>\nZip\n>\nBZip\n>\nGZip\n>\nNone\nClick\n.\nMacros - Variables and Keys (A, B)\nNOTE\nIn this section, we use the terms\nvariables\nand\nmacros\ninterchangeably.\nA macro is a piece of placeholder code that tells a DSP to insert predetermined value(s) at a later point, usually when an ad is served.\nMacros facilitate configuring a dynamic report path and/or filename within your custom destination. Click\nnext to File Path and/or File Name to invoke. (A, B)\nYou can\ncombine\none or more of the three macro types:\nGeneral Variables\nTime Variables\nCustom Keys\nGeneral Variables\nNOTE\nTo exit panel with variable names, click outside the border.\nGeneral Variables correspond to campaign entities/filtering criteria (e.g.,\nCampaign, Line Item\n) on top half of SCHEDULE REPORT screen.\nProceed as follows (for paths and filenames):\nREQUIRED\nIf you select (e.g.)\n$CampaignName$\n, you must have specified a campaign to filter on.\nML-SK-Plz review PRO TIP\nPRO TIP\nYou can create a directory path structure based on campaigns and line items, such as:\nReports/CampaignOne/LineItemOne\nReports/CampaignOne/LineItemTwo\nReports/CampaignTwo/LineItemA\nReports/CampaignTwo/LineItemB\nReports/CampaignTwo/LineItemC\nClick variable to include.\nTo append another variable, see notes below and return to step\n1\n.\n>\nNOTE\n- For paths, a forward slash ( / ) will be automatically inserted.\n>\nNOTE\n- For filenames, an underscore ( _ ) will be automatically inserted.\nEdit path or filename as you wish (e.g., add prefix or suffix).\nReturn to\nscheduling report\n.\nTime Variables\nNOTE\nTo exit panel with variable names, click outside the border.\nTime Variables contain timestamps representing (e.g.) when report was run (e.g.,\n$ReportDateTime\n[yyyy-MM-dd]\n$)\n, where the segment in brackets is the date format. This nomenclature can facilitate maintaining separate folders for each day a report is run, or creating a filename that includes the date.\nProceed as follows\n(for paths and filenames):\nClick variable to include.\nTo use customized date/time macros to facilitate creating a DYNAMIC filename such as\nTestReport_02012023_02282023\n, click\nhere\n, and go no further. Otherwise, continue.\nIf you did not use customized date/time macros, you will be inserting a STATIC date (e.g.,\n2023-03-20\n). In this case, the variable name is arbitrary and used as a placeholder.\nReplace date format within brackets with a STATIC date. The time of day/time zone (e.g.,\nT13:42:23-04:00\n) will be appended automatically.\n>\nEXAMPLE\n-\n$ReportDateTime\n[<Insert date here>]\n$.csv\n>\nIMPORTANT\n-\nML-SK:\nWe strongly recommend using dashes, as slashes could be misinterpreted as part of a path, and periods as filename delimiters\n.\n>\nPRIVATE NOTE -\n4/21/23 SK - Is the above OK? Or should I remove the expalanation (\"....as slashes...\")\nTo append another variable, see notes below, clear the DATE/TIME FORMATS\nscreen by clicking\nOpen General Variables\n. (A) and return to step\n1\n.\n>\nNOTE\n- For paths, a forward slash (\n/\n) will be automatically inserted.\n>\nNOTE\n- For paths, an underscore (\n_\n) will be automatically inserted.\nEdit path or filename as you wish (e.g., add prefix or suffix).\nReturn to\nscheduling report\n.\nCustom Date/Time Variables\nCustom Date/Time Macros add flexibility to date/time-based path names/filenames you build. The screen below displays as soon as you select a date/time variable. Click\nhere\nfor explanations of each variable.\nTo return to the main variable list, click\nOpen General Variables\n. (A)\nEXAMPLE\nTo create a date in\nMMDDYYYY\nformat per the filename\nTestReport_03272023\n, the format is\n%m%d%Y\nwhere:\n%m\n= Two-digit month\n%d\n= Two-digit day\n%Y\n= Four-digit year\nStart here.\nTo insert these macros\nwithin the brackets\n, either click macro symbols, or type them manually. Result (at bottom of screenshot):\nTo attain abovementioned filename, position cursor at beginning of field and type prefix.\nResult (at bottom of screenshot):\nReturn to\nscheduling report\n.\nNOTE\nTo attain path name or filename with delimiters, type the delimiters between each variable.\nML-SK:We strongly recommend using dashes, as slashes could be misinterpreted\nas part of a path, and periods as a filename delimiter.\nPRIVATE NOTE - Lose the explanation? (\"....as slashes could be...)\nML-SK: If you type a single % sign, you get something like: 2023-04-26-T22:03:42-04:00\nIs that intended? Should it be documented?\nML-SK-Plz review PRO TIP\nPRO TIP\nYou can create a directory path structure and filenames based on date/timestamps per the below example. We use\nMMDDYYY\nfor the date and\nHHMM\nfor the time.\nDirectory:\nReports/04012023\nFilename:\nTest\n1002\nFilename:\nTest1853\nDirectory:\nReports/04022023\nFilename:\nTest\n0857\nFilename:\nTest1234\nFilename:\nTest\n2128\nCustom Keys\nCustom keys/variables provide a convenient way to define your report file path or filename in alignment with specific naming conventions. They correspond to custom fields (e.g.,\nIndication\n) defined at\ncampaign\n,\nline-item\n, or\ntactic\nlevel for this account. (e.g.,\n$Key[\nIndication\n]$\n).\nNOTE\nTo exit panel with variable names, click outside the border.\nREQUIRED\nIf you select (e.g.) a campaign-level field:\nYou must be filtering on a specific campaign.\nThis custom field for that campaign must contain data.\nProceed as follows\n(for paths and filenames):\nClick key to include. The\nvalue\nof the custom key for the campaign in question (e.g.,\nTest123\n) will be included in the path or filename.\nTo append another key, see notes below, and return to step\n1\n.\n>\nNOTE\n- For paths, a forward slash ( / ) will be automatically inserted.\n>\nNOTE\n- For filenames, an underscore ( _ ) will be automatically inserted.\nEdit path or filename as you wish (e.g., add prefix and/or suffix).\nReturn to\nscheduling report\n.\nHybrid Paths/Filenames\nYou can combine different types of variables when creating a path or filename. The example below shows a path consisting of general variables (yellow highlights) and time variables (orange highlights).\nNOTE\nYou may need to click the\nicon to redisplay the variables.\nAdd Custom Destination\nYou can add your own custom destination for report delivery.\nNOTE\nClick\nhere\nto edit a custom destination.\nClick\nin the\nDestination\nfield of the\nSCHEDULED REPORT screen\n.\nEnter name.\nSelect destination type and proceed to corresponding section.\n>\nFTP\n>\nSFTP\n>\nS3\n>\nGCP\nFTP\nWe support storing reports on an FTP server.\nEnter host.\nEnter username for logging into FTP host.\nEnter password for login.\nEnter port on FTP server.\nML-SK:(OPTIONAL)\n:\nEnter path of FTP destination/folder.

Clinical Behavior prioritizes bidding on brand-relevant digitally engaged HCPs, those that haven’t recently prescribed the brand, and/ or HCPs that have prescribed competitive drugs.\nQ: Does Clinical Behavior optimize for diagnoses and treatment signals as well?\nA\n:  No, only for Rx (prescription) writing behavior through drug names.\nQ: How does Clinical Behavior optimization work?\nA\n:  Clinical Behavior uses digital, clinical, and audience attribute signals to score HCPs by their likelihood to prescribe a target script, and bids more on those with the higher likelihood to prescribe.\nAll bid optimizations will optimize based on the price you submit within the bid limitations you choose per tactic. Only the addition of bid multipliers would increase bids above the base bid.\nQ: When should I use Clinical Behavior optimization?\nA\n: When an HCP campaign goal is prioritizing conversions.\nQ: What targeting rules work with Clinical Behavior?\nA\n: All HCP applicable targeting rules in Life, such as Direct Match (including Smart Lists), HCP by Specialty, Demographics, Geo Radius, Weather Signals, etc.\nQ: Where can I activate Clinical Behavior optimization in Life?\nA\n: In Bid Strategy under Tactic Settings, select “Clinical Behavior” for your  Optimization Strategy.\nFor optimal results, include the Drug and Market Basket Drug fields in Campaign Details.  Market Basket Drug is one or more drugs that you deem a competitor or complementary treatment to the drug being advertised for the campaign.

They are treated as additional dimensions.\nCreate Template\nNOTE\nYour template applies only to the current (default) advertiser, which displays at upper-right of application.\nFrom\nReport Builder - Main Screen\n, click\n.\n>\nHINT\n- To access the abovementioned screen, navigate to\nReporting --> HCP365 Reports\n.\nEnter template name. (A)\nYou start on the DIMENSIONS tab, which contains dimensions and metrics. (B)\n>\nHINT\n- To select all available dimensions and metrics, click\n. (G)\n>>\nNOTE\n- This action may result in numerous selected entities.\n>\nHINT\n- To delete all selected columns and start over, click\n. (H)\nDimensions\n:\nSelect dimensions (rows), which represent how to group your data. (F)\nThey will display in the SELECTED COLUMNS pane. (D)\nMetrics\n:\nScroll down to\nMetrics\nheading.

Please refer to the example below.\nDimensions\n(including the\nDay\ncolumn) group your data per what entities you are reporting on. Each row represents a unique permutation of dimensions.\nMetrics\nrepresent the actual data you wish to see.\nAdd Custom Date/Time Columns\nBy default, your reports contain the timestamp of a row's data in the first column, treated as a\ndimension\n.\nThis option supports supplementing this column with your own column(s) containing date/time info formatted as you wish. They are treated as\ndimensions\n. The position of the additional columns may differ in your reports.\nAside from the above example, for up-to-the-second event reporting, you can specify the time of day, either as one field, or separate fields. They are treated as\ndimensions\n. You may see more rows since we break down the data by the most granular time unit. The position of the additional columns may differ in your reports.\nProceed as follows:\nClick\n.\nClick\nAdd Custom Date/Time Column\n.\nEnter column name. (You can specify anything you want.)\nSpecify date/time format to display,\ncomponent-by-component\n(e.g., Month).\nClick\nto display list of date/time formats.\n>\nHINT\n- Hover over symbol to display resultant formatting.\nClick symbol(s) to add formats, per the following two examples. The second example depicts a multi-component format for the data in column\nTest Date\n.\n(OPTIONAL): Modify delimiters as needed. In the above example, they default to periods. Change by\ncarefully\nediting this field.\nClick\nto save. The column displays in the SELECTED COLUMNS pane.\nTo add another custom date/time column, return to step\n1\n.\nIf applicable, continue\ncreating template\n.\nEdit Template\nUsing the instructions in\nCreate Template\nas a guideline, you can perform actions such as:\n> Edit template name. (A)\n> Add/remove Dimensions/Metrics (via the Dimensions tab). (B)\n> Add/remove NPI Attributes. (C)\nClick\n.\nYour changes will affect all reports generated with this template going forward.",

PLEASE DO NOT SHARE\n***********************************************************\nThe Dashboard\nOverview\nTab provides a combined view across channels such as\nSite\nand\nSearch\n.\nDashboard Overview Screen\nNOTE\nThe date displayed on the upper-left applies to the entire\nOverview\ndashboard. (S)\nGlobal Settings/Operations\nThe dashboard supports the following functionality:\nSpecify Match Type\n. (A)\nOperations\n. (R)\ne.g., Reload Data.\nSpecify Filters\n. (B, C, D)\ne.g., Time Frame.\nCharts and Graphs\nHover over various charts/graphs to view additional data.\nKey Measures (E)\nKey Measures provide a high-level view of events (recorded interactions made by a user) such as clicks, impressions, or pageviews. The data on the chart below represents the sum of the\nSite\nand\nSearch\nchannels. It displays how effective PulsePoint has been in identifying NPIs.\nPrivate Notes [6/13:1]\nPlease review definitions, in particular:\nIs verb \"originating\" correct? I liked it better than \"initiated\" or \"made\".\nFor Identified NPIs, should the syntax be same as above 3 events (that's how it is in the application, but thinking we could be more consistent.)\n****************************PLEASE IGNORE*** ****************\nDEFINITIONS (Event-Based)  (Stephen)\nTotal Events\n: Total count of events originating from a user who may or may not be an HCP. (BB)\nHCP Events\n: Total count of events originating from an HCP but who may or may not have an NPI linked to event. (CC)\nNPI Events:\nTotal count of events originating from an HCP with an NPI linked to event. (DD)\nIdentified NPIs\n: Distinct count of NPIs, that HCP365 has identified at the individual level, who have been exposed to event. (AA)\nPoP:\nPeriod-Over-Period measure (percent) comparing prior Time Frame to selected Time Frame. (AA, BB, CC, DD)\nEXAMPLE:\nIf current Time Frame is\n7/16\nto\n7\n/19\n(\n4\ndays), previous Time Frame is\n7/12\nto\n7/15\n(\n4\ndays)\n.\nThis percent displays below the actual value (see brown outline above).\nDEFINITIONS (Event-Based)  (Application)\nEvents\n: An Event is a recorded interaction made by a user. Example\nEvents\nare clicks, impressions, pageviews, email opens, etc.\nTotal Events:\nTotal Events are the total count of\nevents\ninitiated by a user, which may or may not be an HCP. (BB)\nHCP Events:\nThe total count of\nevents\nthat were made by an HCP, but may or may not have an NPI number linked with the events. (CC)\nNPI Events:\nA total count of\nevents\nthat were made by an HCP with an NPI linked to an event. (DD)\nSubtract\nNPI Events\nfrom\nHCP Events\nto calculate the number of HCP Events that do not have a linked NPI number. Per the above screenshot,\n3,221 - 1,228 = 1,993\n.\nIdentified NPIs:\nDistinct count of NPIs, that HCP365 has identified at the individual level, who have been exposed to an event.. (AA)\nPoP:\nPeriod over period measure comparing the prior Time Frame to the selected Time Frame. (AA, BB, CC, DD)\nEXAMPLE:\nIf current Time Frame is\n6\n/13\nto 6\n/19\n(\n7\ndays), previous Time Frame is\n6/6 to\n6/12.\nThese percents display below the actual values (see brown outline above).\nA positive percent signifies an increase.\nThe funnel on the left compares various event-type metrics.

So perhaps if one segment is underperforming, users can see this in real time and make adjustments to the bidding strategy to optimize outcomes.\nWhether a marketer is defining the campaign goal at the start and then refining strategy mid-flight as changes in budget pacing, ad engagement and conversion rates occur, PulsePoint’s audience-based bid optimizations are a game changer for reaching higher value audiences in the most cost efficient way.\nQ: How does Audience Quality optimization affect bidding?\nA\n:  All bid optimizations generate bid prices from $0.01 to $BaseBid. Only the addition of bid multipliers would increase bids above the $BaseBid. In that case, any bid optimization would be bound by the $MaxBid price defined in Bid Strategy settings.\nA tactic’s budget distribution priority compared to other tactics in a line item does not affect bid pricing.\nQ: What targeting rules work with Audience Quality?\nA\n: All DTC applicable targeting rules in Life, such as Demographics, Geo Radius, Weather Signals, etc.\nQ: Where can a user activate Audience Quality optimization in the platform?\nA\n: In Bid Strategy under Tactic Settings, select the dropdown menu for\nOptimization Strategy\nand scroll down to select\nAudience Quality\n.\nA diagnosis field will appear, indicating that users need to input a diagnosis name(s), such as anemia, for Audience Quality optimization.\nNote that selecting a single diagnosis, or a few related diagnoses, will render optimal results. If disassociated diagnoses are selected, AQ optimization will not work properly.\nIf the diagnosis field has not been completed, users will see a tooltip indicating that it must be to enable AQ optimization.",

Cookieless targeting determines the bid requests targeted by a tactic based on the digital identifiers present in those requests. This ensures that we are able to tie consumer activity back to a unique, privacy-safe identifier, like a RampID.\nCookieless targeting applies alternative methods to reach and engage your target audience. These methods have been developed in reaction to increasing privacy concerns and changes in internet regulations, which have caused major web browsers to phase out support for third-party cookies.\nThis targeting can recoup the reach lost from the reduction in cookies.\nDigital Identifier:\nAll Available\nis selected by default. If\nAll Available\nor\nIdentity\nis selected, you must select the cookieless identity solution to use. For now,\nRampID\nis the only cookieless identity solution available. More will become available in the future.\nIf you selected\nAll Available\nor\nIdentity\n:\nDeliver only when NPI Reporting is available:\n>\nCAUTION\n- Enabling\nthis option can reduce your reach and spend. When you invoke any of the below targeting types, the option is auto-invoked, and you should\nuncheck it if necessary.\n> Applies only if you have invoked HCP Direct Match targeting such as\nNPI Targeting\nand\nHCP by Specialty\ntargeting.\n> We attempt to match all targeted NPIs with an associated RampID. However, some NPIs will not have such a corresponding ID. In this case, your\nreport\nmay include blank NPIs. If you wish to avoid this behavior, click checkbox, and we will deliver only on NPIs who have corresponding RampIDs, subject to the above caution.\nContinue as follows:\n> if you are entering a new tactic, return\nhere\n.\n> If you are editing existing tactic, return\nhere\n.\n> If you are entering a new ad group, return\nhere\n.\n> If you are editing an existing ad group, return\nhere\n.\nReport on Identity Solution\nYou can report on the Identity Provider (e.g.,\nRampID\n)\nthat caused the ad to be served.\nGo to\nReports → Templates\n.\nYour dimensions should include\nIdentity Provider.\nSelect any other desired\ndimensions and metrics\n.\n>\nHINT\n- You may wish to include NPI-related dimension(s) per the HCP checkbox.

Optimize bidding for HCPs most likely to prescribe a target script, given their historical digital and clinical activity.\nFor optimal results, include the Drug and the new Market Basket Drug field in Campaign Details. Market Basket Drug is one or more drugs that the user sees as a competitor or complementary treatment to the drug being advertised for the campaign. This allows PulsePoint to use historical brand and competitor script behavior as part of the optimization.\nBespoke Audiences\nBespoke audiences\nare custom DTC segments, including those that satisfy NAI guidelines for contextual targeting.

      "content": "User Guide\nRequired Bespoke Audiences Criteria\n: Following these guidelines will provide the most effective Bespoke Audiences results.\nUser specific criteria:\nSelf-service, self-service+ and managed service users can access Bespoke Audiences.\nCampaign specific criteria:\nDTC Only:\nBespoke Audiences\nare available for DTC campaigns only.\nFAQ\nGeneral\nQ: What are Bespoke Audiences?\nA\n: Bespoke audiences are custom DTC segments, including those to satisfy NAI guidelines for contextual targeting, modeled using brand-defined criteria available within PulsePoint’s proprietary clinical and real-time digital data foundation.\nQ: Can multiple codes be used for Bespoke Audience creation?\nA\n:  Yes, an ICD-10 diagnosis code, an NDC drug code, JCODE for an injectable drug, and a CPT code for treatment may be used to create a Bespoke audience.\nNote that choosing one code per criteria, e.g. diagnosis, prescription and/ or treatment, for a single audience segment will render optimal results.\nQ: How do Bespoke Audiences work?\nA\n:  Machine learning connects de-identified consumers associated with diagnosis, treatment, or procedural claims with millions of attribute combinations, and ranks them into deciles in order of most to least important to a brand.\nBespoke Audience segments start with de-identified claims to then rank the prevalence of groups of consumer segments with similar ages, genders and zip codes that received a brand-relevant diagnosis, treatment or procedure. For example, when a de-identified consumer has a medical claim that includes a particular ICD-10 code, that individual's information is sent to a clean room with billions of other claims, where their private information is anonymized. Then millions of demographic and location identifiers are used to segment groups of individuals with similar attributes, and rank them by brand relevance. This allows our technology to target the most relevant consumer segments likely to have a target diagnosis in a privacy-safe way.\nBespoke audiences are backed by a database of more than 220M de-identified patients, 300M annual hospital claims, 2B annual medical claims, and 3B annual pharmacy claims, and include segments to satisfy NAI guidelines for contextual targeting.\nQ: How often are Bespoke Audiences refreshed?\nA\n:  Since Bespoke audience attributes include digital native activity, audiences are refreshed daily to ensure users always reach the most relevant audience.\nQ: How can a user activate Bespoke Audiences in Life?\nA\n: Bespoke Audiences are created upon client request to sales reps.\nQ: How long does it take to activate Bespoke Audiences in Life?\nA\n: Upon client request, Bespoke Audience creation takes about four weeks to complete. The turnaround time to confirm feasibility and rough impression estimates is four days. Upon creation, Bespoke Audiences will become visible for external users under Health Journey targeting rules.\nCompetitive differentiation\nQ: What makes our modeled audiences different than everyone else's in this very crowded space:\nA:\nClients can customize Bespoke Audiences based on billions of diagnosis, treatment, or procedural claims available, with millions of attribute combinations, to reach audience deciles most relevant to a brand.\nReal-time digital native activity is a proprietary component of Bespoke Audiences, and is derived from contextualizing the pages, apps, and environments we track across the internet, given 200B ad requests we receive daily.\nMany marketers rely on purchasing several static segments from various data partners to ensure the widest possible reach among target audiences. Instead of this costly and outdated approach, PulsePoint leverages its data partnerships to create proprietary, live audience segments that will refresh daily to ensure users always reach the most relevant audience.\nThere are also Bespoke Audience models available to satisfy NAI guidelines for contextual targeting.",

This nomenclature can facilitate maintaining separate folders for each day a report is run, or creating a filename that includes the date.\nProceed as follows\nfor paths and filenames:\nClick variable.\n*****************REMOVED\n*****************\nTo use customized date/time macros\nto facilitate creating a DYNAMIC filename such as\nTestReport_02012023_02282023\n, click\nhere\n, and go no further. Otherwise, continue.\nIf you did not use customized date/time macros, you will be inserting a STATIC date (e.g.,\n2023-03-20\n). The variable name is arbitrary and used as a placeholder.\nReplace date format within brackets with STATIC date. The time of day and time zone (e.g.,\nT13:42:23-04:00\n) will be appended automatically.\n>\nEXAMPLE\n-\n$ReportDateTime\n[<Insert date here>]\n$.csv\n> IMPORTANT\n-\nWe strongly recommend using dashes as delimiters.\nTo append another variable, see notes below, clear the DATE/TIME FORMATS\nscreen by clicking\nOpen General Variables\n.

PLEASE DO NOT SHARE\n***********************************************************\nIntroduction\nYou can create a report template to use when\nrunning an on-demand report\nor\nscheduling a report\n.\nReport templates consist of:\nDimensions\n(rows) which represent how you wish to group your data.\nMetrics\n(columns).\nOptional\nNPI Attributes\n, consisting of data from\nNPI lists with attributes\n. They are treated as additional dimensions.\nCreate/Edit Template\nFrom Reports - Main Screen, click\n.\nEnter template name. (A)\nYou start on the DIMENSIONS tab, which contains dimensions and metrics. (B)\n>\nHINT\n- To select all available dimensions and metrics, click\n. (G)\n>>\nIMPORTANT\n- This action may result in an extensive number of columns.\n>\nHINT\n- To delete all selected columns and start over, click\nat any time. (H)\nDimensions\n:\n>\nHINT\n- You can enter dimension name in\nSearch\nfield. (G)\nSelect dimensions (rows), which represent how you wish to group your data. (F)\nThey will display in the SELECTED COLUMNS pane. (D)\nMetrics\n:\n>\nHINT\n- You can enter metric name in\nSearch\nfield.

(See example below.) (D)\n>\nCAUTION\n- If you remove the list name, all selected columns will be unselected. (AA)\n(OPTIONAL): Click\nto\nadd custom date/time columns\n. (E)\nSelected columns (per steps\n4\n-\n7\n) display per the following example. (Your column order may differ.)\n> Dimensions (Green border) (AA)\n> Metrics (Blue border) (BB)\n> NPI Attributes (Green border) (CC)\n>> Treated as additional dimensions.\n(OPTIONAL): Drag column names to reorder.\n>\nPRO TIP\n-\nIn the above example, you can use this technique to group the NPI dimensions in the last three columns (CC) with the other dimensions. (AA)\nClick\n.\nNOTE\nA suffix (e.g.,\nLast_Name (My List)\n), after a column label (in both the above screen, and the output file) is used to differentiate between fields with the same name that exist in multiple NPI lists with attributes.\nDimensions and Metrics\nReports contain\ndimensions\nand\nmetrics\n. Please refer to the simplified example below.\nDimensions group your data per what entities you are reporting on. Each row represents a unique permutation of dimensions, highlighted in yellow.\nMetrics represent the actual data you wish to see, highlighted in orange.\nAdd Custom Date/Time Columns\nBy default, your reports contain the timestamp of a row's data in the first column, per this simplified example.\nThis option supports supplementing this column with your own column(s) containing date/time info formatted as you wish.\nAside from the above example, for up-to-the-second event reporting, you can also specify time of day, either as one field, or separate fields. You may see more rows, since we break down the data by the most granular time unit.\nProceed as follows:\nClick\n.\nClick\nAdd Custom Date/Time Column\n.\nEnter column name.\nSpecify date/time format to display,\ncomponent-by-component\n(e.g., Month).\nClick\nto display list of date/time formats.\n>\nHINT\n- Hover over symbol to display resultant formatting.\nClick symbol(s) to add formats, per the following two examples. The second example depicts a multi-component format for the data in column\nTest Date\n.\n(OPTIONAL): Modify delimiters as needed. In the above example, they default to periods. Change by\ncarefully\nediting this field.\nClick\nto save. The column displays in the SELECTED COLUMNS pane.\nTo add another custom date/time column, return to step\n1\n.\nIf applicable, continue\ncreating template\n.",

      "content": "The following features have been added to the HCP365 platform. For questions, please contact your Account Manager at\nHCP365support@pulsepoint.com\n.\nMatch Type\nImproved Attribution Methodology\nWhile always improving methods to gain higher NPI reach, the change to how we name match types is essential. This change is to display a clear delineation among the three match types available in the platform today.\nThe retroactive change will be as follows:\nDirect ID change to Personal Device\nCross Device changes to Associated Device Attribution\nMulti-Source IP changes to Associated Network Attribution\nThese labels will be found in the Match Type selector within all dashboards, within Smart Actions, and when selecting match_type as a dimension from reporting.\nNPI List Name\nFiltering and Dimensionality\nExtended functionality enabling the selection of multiple NPI Lists for filtering and single record overlap of NPI Lists.\nFiltering\n- With the ability to select multiple NPI lists it is now possible to display only those exposures to one or many NPI Lists.\nFor example, Setting an NPI list from tier 1 - tier 3 segmentation of HCPs can be sliced and diced towards the top two tiers if desired.\nReporting\n- One single event where no NPI filtering is selected, but the dimension of NPI List Name is selected, a record will show all NPI Lists that overlap with that NPI attributed to the event. When incorporated with filtering, only those NPI Lists selected will be reflected.\nEmail as a Channel\nNew Dashboards\nGain a closer understanding of the complete footprint of brand targeted HCPs with access to cross-channel NPI exposure to email. The Email dashboard provides insights of HCPs who have opened email and clicked through to brand.com.\nEmail Optimization\n- Allows users to understand the performance of their email marketing campaigns. This layout can be used in guiding campaign adjustments for improved engagement\nEmail Click Performance\n- A percentage measure of the distribution across a given dimension. This is used to help understand where an email campaign is yielding the highest open and click rate.\nReport Builder\nAll reporting that leverages the channel dimension will now include Email as a value, in addition to the availability of the measures, Email Opens and Email Clicks.\nSmart Actions\nReal-time personalization marketing enabled to HCPs who have engaged with brand.com and opened an email using the Smart Action workflow.\n*NOTE: All email reporting and Smart Actions require the email pixel to be implemented within the email service provider. These pixels are available from the setup tab in the HCP365 platform.\nCreate Sublists from NPI Lists With Attributes\nNPI sublist creation based on the metadata of a parent NPI list is now available. Some benefits include:\nActionable list segmentation\nImproved organization and minimized duplication\nEasy to manage - Changes of parent will funnel down to children\nHow it works:\nUpload an NPI list with attributes.\nOnce uploaded, set up rules for filters to create sublists based on NPIs attributes, allowing the attributes to become a trigger for the creation of various sublists.\nSublists can be used as a filter or in smart actions just like any other NPI list.\nNPI List API\nUsers can now automatically update NPI lists with system integrations like CRM data or 3rd-party data, without the need to manually manage within the platform. Clients now have direct access and complete control of their standard NPI lists and NPI lists with attributes via the NPI List API.\nPassword Resetting Every 90 Days\nExternal user passwords will now need to be updated every\n90\ndays according to new security policy. You will receive a reminder email five days in advance of the password reset.",

For questions, please contact your Account Manager at\nHCP365support@pulsepoint.com\n.\nReport Builder Enhancements\nNPI List with Attributes\nIt is now possible to create reporting templates that utilize uploaded NPI lists with Attributes. Incorporating your own custom NPI attributes adds new dimensionality that caters to a specific need, such as reporting by attributes passed along in CRM data, or HCP tiered classifications, for example.\nAdditional Dimensions and Alignment\nDimensions, such as time frame, collection details, campaign details, and metric fields (measures), have been organized, modified and added to the Report Builder to match dimensions within the Analytics tab and dashboard reporting. Previously all fields were selected when creating a new template which forced users to deselect each unwanted dimension and measure. This release will no longer preselect the available fields.\nBelow is a summary of changes made:\nAll field names are lowercase with the ability to modify to uppercase.\nField names that once contained spaces are replaced with underscores.\nNew fields include:\nsource_type: A categorization of the result found in the Source dimension.  Definitions of each major source type can be found below:\nDirect Buy\nProgrammatic\nPaid Search\nOrganic Search\nSocial\nNative\nEmail\nPrint\nAudio\nUnknown Source Type\ncampaign_id: Identifier of the Campaign directly linked to the Campaign Name.\ntactic_name: Composite field leveraging a rules based hierarchy of directly passed values, and referral and page parameters, to provide a single source dimension of the tactic_name. The naming of \"tactic_name\" is a generalized term within an ad delivery platform. Other names for tactic may include, placement, flight, ad group, etc.\nad_type: Composite field leveraging a rules based hierarchy of directly passed values, and referral and page parameters, to provide a single source dimension of the ad_type. The naming of \"ad_type\" is a generalized term within an ad delivery platform. Other names for ad type may include, creative type, ad format, etc.\nmatch_type*: Indication of the Signal NPI assignment (Direct ID, Cross Device, Multi-Source IP). All NPIs shown in the platform today can be bucketed into these three match types.\nDashboards\nClient Defined, Private Templates\nWith the support of Account Management, users can now define a customized layout or set of layouts that fulfill a specific client need. You can access these templates via the layout dropdown menu. These new layouts can also be set as the default dashboard view.\nMatch Type Selector\nFilters have been added to provide a clear picture behind the method of Signal NPI assignment (Direct ID, Cross Device, Multi-Source IP) utilized at the time of an event.\nNOTE: Available for clients that have opted for the Webhook add-on with All Access packages.\nSmart Actions\nMatch Type Triggering\nThis enhanced capability sets the degree of NPI assignment for adding an NPI to a Smart List and/or a Webhook.There are three levels of scale – Direct ID, Cross Device, and Multi-Source IP. Each of the levels is in order of hierarchy and functions as such. For example, if Cross Device is selected then the action will trigger when an NPI is discovered using Direct ID and Cross Device match types.\nNOTE: Available for clients that have opted for the Webhook add-on with All Access packages.",

These views will focus on catering to an actionable need, for example campaign optimization. For this launch we will be providing two new layouts centered around Optimization for the Search and Media. These will give clients direction in pinpointing opportunities towards improving future reach efficiency. Users can toggle between layouts as needed.\nSearch Optimization\nAllows users to understand the performance of their search campaigns using the targetable attributes found within search ad management platforms. This layout can be used in guiding campaign adjustments to help reach the desired NPIs that fit the brand’s needs.\nNew measures include:\nClick Performance\n- A percentage measure of the distribution across a given dimension. This is used to help understand where a search campaign is having the greatest impact.\nMedia Optimization\nAllows users to understand the performance of their media campaigns using the targetable attributes commonly found within ad management platforms. These can be used in guiding campaign adjustments to help reach the desired NPIs that fit the brand’s needs.\nNew measures include:\nNPI Media Clicks and NPI Media CTR (Click Through Rate)\n- Understand where, when and by whom those NPIs are clicking.\nRenaming of Ad Impressions to Media Impressions for consistency.\nClinical Insights Top Performers - Prescriptions, Procedures and Diagnosis\nClinical Insights widgets have been added to Site, Search, and Media to showcase the top 10 prescriptions, procedures and diagnosis for exposed NPIs, with results also summarized in the Overview tab. Users can layer on NPI target lists to gain an understanding of the clinical actions taken by those NPIs in target.\nNOTE: These are aggregate measures and NPI granularity is not yet available.\nTIP: Hover your mouse over the chart bars to have visibility to the full names and descriptions\nReport Builder Enhancements\nAdd Custom Date/Timestamp to Reports\nUsers can now report in any date/format desired within Report Builder templates.\nScheduled Reports\nUsers can now create custom reporting and schedule email delivery of those reports through report builder, at a desired date, time and frequency.  To schedule the email delivery of custom reports, you must have the reporting add-on to your HCP365 package.\nAdditional Dimensions and Aggregate Measures\nCustom reporting aggregations were previously only available within the Analytics Dashboard.\nBelow are a list of added report dimensions within Scheduled Custom Reports:\nAccount ID\nAccount Name\nAdvertiser name\nAdvertiser ID\nAgency\nCollection Name\nUser Type\nIs_npi\nMatch_type*\nSource\nChannel → Channel Name\nChannel ID\nSearch Term**\n*Available to HCP365 All Access licenses with the Advanced Smart Actions add on that includes webhooks and match type\n**Search Term is newly added to both Scheduled Custom Reports and the Analytics Dashboard.

Listed NPIs will be matched to associated email addresses through HealthLink Dimension’s extensive email supply, with an average 98% match rate. Emails are then sent to NPIs on the provided NPI lists at the discretion of the client.\nQ: How do Triggered emails work?\nA\n:  Once HCPs engage with PulsePoint media and/or visit a defined brand website page, they are automatically added to an associated email sequence via HealthLink Dimension’s distribution platform. This automated deployment relies on PulsePoint’s proprietary Smart Actions technology.\nClients can create multiple email sequences for multiple email campaigns using the same Smart Action triggers. A static NPI list or automated Smart List may also be added to Smart Action criteria to identify engaged HCPs who are also on client NPI lists.\nQ: Are all Smart Actions available for Triggered emails?\nA\n:  No, only the following are available:\nExposed to media\nClicks on media\nClicks search ad\nVisit brand page\nQ: What is needed for Triggered email setup?\nA\n: A Smart Pixel needs to be installed on the brand site for the “Visit a Brand Page” trigger to be activated.\nQ: Do Smart Lists work with Email Channel Activation?\nA\n: Smart Lists can be used for Triggered emails. However, only the Smart PIxel option within a Smart List is applicable.\nSmart Lists cannot be used for Standard emails.\nQ: Do targeting rules work with Email Channel Activation?\nA\n: Since Email Channel Activation is managed outside of PulsePoint and not at the line item level, standard targeting rules are not available. However, HCP by specialty and geo targeting is available in Smart Action setup for Triggered Email Activation.\nQ: Why are we working with HealthLink?\nA\n: Today, we’re partnering with HealthLink for HCP email supply and activation, which provides the largest, verified HCP database and email supply covering over 90% of HCP emails across specialties. HealthLink is also the largest clinical email database that is certified and verified by BPA worldwide and has its own proprietary, triple email verification process which eliminates spam traps and ensures a high level of email deliverability, maintaining a 95%+ delivery rate for client Trigger emails. HealthLink’s meticulous management of their sender domain and IP reputation, along with the necessary supporting processes and platforms, underscores their commitment to ensuring that clients' communications reach their intended recipients reliably and effectively.\nQ: How can a user activate Email Channel Activation?\nA\n: Upon client request to sales reps, an intake form will be completed which includes email campaign criteria and guidelines to ensure that emails meet certain standards for deliverability. Through the intake form, clients will provide the completed HTML with the MLR-approved design, content, and overall layout of the email. Smart Action email trigger requirements, like media frequency and exposed pageview controls, if desired, will be defined in the pre-sale process. Once approved, PulsePoint will set up and manage client email campaigns.\nThe turnaround time from intake form to campaign activation for standard emails takes about a week. For triggered emails, it can take 2-4 weeks depending on what webhooks need to be established for Smart Actions.\nHealthLink email design guidelines:\nMeasurement\nQ: Where is measurement available?\nA:\nFor standard email activation, without the use of Smart Actions triggers, initial reports will be emailed to clients by HealthLink ~3 days post campaign launch once most email campaign engagement has occurred. A secondary, final report will be emailed a few days after the first one.\nReport metrics for standard email includes:\nTotal opens - by campaign and by email\nUnique opens\nTotal clicks  - by campaign and by email\nUnique clicks - by URL\nTotal targets (email addresses deployed)\nDelivery rate\nEngagement across email clients - by client and across all clients\nRead\nSkim read\nGlanced\nTotal engagement\nUnsubscribed\nReading environment (e.g. mobile, desktop, webmail)\nEmail clients (e.g. AppleMail, Outlook)\nBrowser usage (e.g. Chrome, Safari)\nReport metrics for standard email DOES NOT include:\nEmail addresses associated with NPIs\nFor triggered email activation, with the use of Smart Actions triggers, reports will be emailed to clients from PulsePoint in Excel format a month post campaign launch and on a monthly basis.\nReport metrics for triggered email includes:\nEmails sent\nUnique NPIs\nEmails delivered\nEmails opened\nEmail clicks\nEmail unsubscribes\nReport metrics for triggered email DOES NOT include:\nAd clicks\nEmail addresses associated with NPIs\nNo reporting is available directly in the PulsePoint platform.",

      "content": "User Guide\nRequired Trigger Email Activation Criteria\n:\nFollowing these guidelines will provide the most effective Trigger Email Activation results.\nUser specific criteria:\nSelf-service, self-service+ and managed service users can access Trigger Email Activation as a managed service only.\nCampaign specific criteria:\nHCP Only:\nTrigger Email Activation is available for HCP campaigns only.\nFAQ\nWhat it is, How it Works, Setup\nQ: What is trigger email activation?\nA\n: Trigger email activation is a managed service that deploys a single email or sequence of emails to target HCPs via automated, triggered-based emails.\nTriggered emails are sent automatically to HCPs chosen to be on an NPI target list, post-engagement with PulsePoint media and/or a brand’s website.\nThe PulsePoint team works with clients to create and activate email(s) through its partnership with HealthLink Dimensions.\nQ: How do trigger emails work?\nA\n: Once HCPs engage with PulsePoint media and/or visit a defined brand website page, they are automatically added to an associated email sequence via HealthLink Dimension’s distribution platform.\nYou can create multiple email sequences for multiple email campaigns using any combination of Smart Action triggers. A static NPI list or automated NPI Smart List\nTM\nmay also be added to Smart Action criteria to identify engaged HCPs who are also on client NPI lists.\nQ: Are all Smart Actions available for trigger emails?\nA\n: No, only the following are available.\nClicks on media: including frequency control.\nVisit brand page: including # of exposed pageviews and custom URLs visited or ignored.\nQ: Is frequency capping available for trigger email sends?\nA:\nYes. Users can define email resend limits as well as the number of days to wait before resending an unopened email, which is typically between 2-5 days.\nUsers can also limit the number of repeated emails a recipient will get depending on how often the email trigger is re-initiated by the same person. It is recommended that recipients do not receive the same email multiple times in a month.\nQ: Can NPIs on a client target list be excluded from an email send?\nA:\nYes. Users can provide an exclusion list during the campaign setup process.\nQ: What is needed for trigger email setup?\nA\n: A\nSmart Pixel\nneeds to be installed on your brand site for the “Visit a Brand Page” trigger to be activated.\nQ: What email address will be used to send emails?\nA:\nThe domain used for all triggered emails is @infohcp.com. Users have the ability to change the information to the left of the @ sign at their discretion. They can also use discretion to create the From name and address as well. More details can be found in Appendix A below.\nQ: Do NPI Smart Lists work with trigger email?\nA\n:\nNPI Smart Lists\ncan be used for trigger emails. However, only the\nSmart Pixel option within an NPI Smart List\nis applicable. (\nClinical activity triggers\n, for example, are\nnot\napplicable.)\nQ: Do targeting rules work with trigger emails?\nA\n: Since trigger email is managed outside of PulsePoint and not at the line item level, standard targeting rules are not available. However, HCP by specialty and geo targeting is available in Smart Action for audience building during setup for trigger emails.\nQ: Are all devices, channels, inventory and creative types applicable for trigger emails?\nA:\nSince Smart Actions for trigger emails are applicable only to channels where NPI passback is available post-exposure, DOOH/ Billboards, Social and\nEHR\nare NOT applicable. For example, since DOOH activation relies on geo-based targeting where exposed NPIs are not passed back to the platform, we cannot directly trigger an email to NPIs who’ve been exposed to DOOH campaigns.\nQ: Why are we working with HealthLink?\nA\n: Today, we’re partnering with HealthLink for HCP email supply and activation, which provides the largest, verified HCP database and email supply covering over 90% of HCP emails across specialties. HealthLink is also the largest clinical email database that is certified and verified by\nBPA worldwide\nand has its own proprietary, triple email verification process which eliminates spam traps and ensures a high level of email deliverability, maintaining a 95%+ delivery rate for client Trigger emails. HealthLink’s meticulous management of their sender domain and IP reputation, along with the necessary supporting processes and platforms, underscores their commitment to ensuring that clients' communications reach their intended recipients reliably and effectively.\nQ: How can a user activate trigger emails?\nA\n: Upon activation request, an intake form will be completed by PulsePoint on behalf of the client, which includes email campaign criteria and guidelines (See\nAppendix A\nbelow) to ensure that emails meet certain standards for deliverability. Through the intake form, clients will provide the completed HTML with the MLR-approved design, content, and overall layout of the email. Smart Action email trigger requirements, like media frequency and exposed pageview controls, if desired, will be defined in the pre-sale process. Once approved, PulsePoint will set up and manage client email campaigns.\nThe turnaround time from intake form to campaign activation for trigger emails can take 2-4 weeks depending on what webhooks need to be established for Smart Actions.\nMeasurement\nQ: Is email measurement available?\nA\n:\nFor triggered email activation, with the use of Smart Actions triggers, reports will be emailed to clients from PulsePoint in Excel format a month post campaign launch.\nReport metrics for triggered email includes:\nEmails sent\nUnique NPIs (98% average NPI to email address match rate from beta tests)\nEmails delivered (96% average delivery rate from beta tests)\nEmails opened\nEmail clicks\nEmail unsubscribes\nReport metrics for triggered email DOES NOT include:\nAd clicks\nEmail addresses associated with NPIs\nIn-platform reporting on email performance is only available for HCP365 clients. Contact your PulsePoint representative if you are interested in learning more.\nQ: If I’m also an HCP365 user and activate trigger-based emails, what additional analytics will I have access to?\nA:\nDaily, enhanced email reporting metrics via a PulsePoint dashboard to improve campaign engagement mid-flight, including:\nCTR Heatmap Engagement by the Day/Hour, Exposure Frequency, and Campaign/Line Item Breakdown\nEngagement Reporting Heatmaps by Audience Attributes (age, gender, geo and specialty)\nEmail reach by Profession and Specialty\nID NPI Cross-channel Measurement (PP Media and beyond via HCP365 All Access)\nAppendix A - Design Guidelines\nFrom Name and From Line Guidelines\nThe From Name is the “Vanity Name” that most email clients will display which should represent your Company/Brand/ Person or Project.\nBe descriptive, not deceptive! Use something easily recognizable like your company name, so the reader knows what to expect and is more likely to open your message.\nFrom Address is your brand or company name which precedes the HealthLink sending domain: infohcp.com.\nFrom Address Example: Brand/CompanyName@infohcp.com\nSubject Line Guidelines\nSubject Lines are your “billboard” in the inbox. To get a recipient to open your email, an engaging subject line is key.  Here are a few tips:\nShorter is better – 6-10 words and under 75 characters. Absolute MAX is 100.\nUse personalization whenever possible, such as the recipient’s first name or “Dr. [last name].” Salutations like \"Dear\" and titles like \"Dr.\" can be included if they are added in the HTML.\nBe direct and front-load your subject line so that the recipient is pulled in immediately.\nAvoid spammy, misleading, or overtly salesy language.\nIt is recommended to try different subject lines instead of “recycling” the same one – especially for resends.\nConsider Unbranded and Disease state related subjects\nSome suggestions: Offer value, ask questions or present a benefit or time-saver\nUse subject lines in conjunction with preheader\nPre-Header Text Guidelines\nThe Pre-Header Text is a great space to write a short (max 90 characters) and enticing call to action directly below the subject line.\nCombined with the subject line, preheaders are used to capture attention\nThis should give the recipient more information on what is in the email, not just repeat or reiterate your subject.\nPre-Header Text should be provided in the HTML or Insertion Order, so it can be inserted by our team for your campaign.\nAndroid devices show approximately 47 characters; iPhones show approximately 65-70 characters\nIt is preferred to directly program the preheader into your HTML.\nImage Guidelines\nSimple is better\nIndividual images should not exceed 30KB\nLarge images render poorly and make for a poor user experience\nDo not waste space using a large image masthead\nImages can trigger SPAM flags\nImage to text ratio should be less than 30%\nBackground images (not to be confused with images that occupy the full width of the e- mail) are not permitted, as they do not render appropriately across various email clients and can cause the email to be distorted.\nAvoid Flash. Many recipients will not have the compatible computer platform, email software or correct version they need to render media-rich functions correctly. Instead, host these functions, including audio, video, or Flash, on a Web site instead of embedding them in an email. Link readers directly to these functions on your site.\nOpt Out and Footer Guidelines\nCAN-SPAM requires a valid\nphysical postal address\nin the content/footer of every email. Please be aware that a post-office box or mail drop is not sufficient, as the address must be somewhere that a consumer can physically find the advertiser’s business. The postal address must be that of the advertiser.\nOpt Out and Unsubscribe language should be included in the HTML creative to comply with CAN-SPAM. If not provided, HealthLink will include the standard UNSUBSCRIBE link.\nHealthLink will honor unsubscribe requests immediately and will provide any emails that have opted out of receiving emails from client upon request.\nCoding Guidelines\nKeep email width to a maximum of 640 px (under 600 px is ideal).\nHTML file should not exceed 80KB (smaller is better), not including images within the email. The recommended size is under 70KB.\nGmail and some other ESP’s start clipping emails at 102kb,\nheavier files have a greater chance of being rejected or landing in spam\nIf the file is larger, you can minify the code using an online tool that condenses the code, this will make it almost impossible to edit so this should only be applied to final approved versions\nHyperlinks – keep the URL clean and not wrapped in a Proofpoint URL defense as this causes an additional redirect that can hurt delivery and inbox placement\nUse tables as email framework and set width for each cell. Use pixels, NOT percentage- based widths.  Again, the maximum with should be no greater than 640 px.\nUse basic cross-platform or web-based fonts (for example: Arial, Verdana, Georgia, Times New Roman, Roboto, Open Sans).\nText should be coded as text wherever possible and not obfuscated within an image.\nJavaScript is not permitted.\nEmbedded video is not permitted, as it is universally supported. If video is desired, use a screenshot of the video screen (make sure to have a “play” arrow overlaid to indicate that a video will play upon clicking) and link to the video online.",

I've re-uploaded the updated code\nHERE\n. Once this is updated, it should resolve the redirect / click-thru issue.\nPlease note, we've also refreshed the tokenIDs so for both the Impression and Click pixels- it should reflect\ntoken=KAVFKZYUY3FS\n. Can you ensure both the impression and click tags reflect this?\nAdditionally, please let me know if you would like to connect live to finalize / troubleshoot if any other changes are needed- avails for tomorrow below:\n11:30-12p or 1-4p ET\nBest,\nLisa\nHi Lisa,\nI just updated the impression and clicks tags with your revised sheets and the test tag is working now!\nThere were two manual adjustments your team should be aware of though. While the new code snippet you provided did fix the redirecting problem, it was also truncating our query string on the final landing page (everything after\nutm_source=\nwas missing when I clicked through an ad). So I had to do two things: first I removed the\n%u\nmacro at the end of the click tag since DCM auto-appends the URL be default after the\nrurl=\nvariable without the need for a macro. I also enabled \"escaping: one level\" in DCM, which stopped our UTM code from being truncated. Just something for your team to be aware of in future implementations!\nI attached screenshots of what was implemented here - please let me know if everything including the new token ID looks correct and none of the manual adjustments will cause issue. If it's all good, we'll append it to the partners' ad tags once trafficking is complete.\nThank you!\nANDREW RYAN\n(HE/HIM)\nASSOCIATE DIRECTOR, MEDIA TECHNOLOGY\nO: +1 215.982.5765",

You can negotiate an exclusive agreement, that includes pricing, with these publishers, rather than participate in an open auction. These deals provide a controlled invite-only environment for buying/selling inventory, benefiting both advertisers and publishers.\nThe\nDeal Pricing\nsection\nof the Tactic Page controls how the Life application bids on these deals as follows:\nIf you add deals here, and they are targeted in the\nPMP Targeting Type\n, you will bid\nonly\non targeted deals.\nIf you add deals here, and there is no\nPMP targeting\n, you will bid on\nboth\nthe private deals and on the open exchange.\nHealth Marketplace/Premium Publishers\nA Health Marketplace (e.g.,\nPremium Publishers\n) is a curated bucket of inventory that comes from a single publisher and provides easy access to a selected set of premium deals and audiences.\nWhen you target an inventory/deal, it will be added to the\nDeal Pricing section\nof the Tactic Page.\nThe\nDeal Pricing section\nof the Tactic Page controls.....????\nDeal Pricing Section\nDeal Pricing\nis located at the bottom of the Tactic Page on the\nSETTINGS\ntab.\nDeals targeted in the\nPMP Targeting Type\nwill appear here.\nDeals targeted in the\nPremium Publishers\ntargeting type (or within other Health Marketplace targeting types) will appear here.\nAdd Deal\nYou can add PMP deals to a tactic.

For questions, please contact your Platform Solutions Manager or Account Manager.\nLIFE MEDIA ACTIVATION\nWorkflow Enhancements\nForecasting Ranges\nForecasting ranges now replace a single number for bid opportunities, total impressions and potential max spend in the Forecasting application and tactic settings. Forecasting ranges offer better insight into:\nCampaign variability\n- have a more accurate representation of potential outcomes\nPotential risk\n- consider changing conditions and user behaviors with greater certainty\nExternal factor influence\n- reflect ad performance changes with seasons, holidays, or events\nAn example of the forecasting ranges displayed in\ntactic settings\nis shown below:\nThese ranges also display in the\nForecasting application\n.\nCreative Management API\nThe Creative Management API allows ad servers to send creative tags directly to PulsePoint, eliminating the need to manually bulk upload creatives. The primary use case for this API is for use with Flashtalking.\nPlease reach out to your PulsePoint representative to request access to the Creative Management API.\nVideo Bulk Upload\nWhen bulk uploading videos, users will now have the option to select VAST or VPAID. Click\nhere\nfor more info.\nReporting Enhancements\nDMA Code Dimension in Report Builder\nA new geographic metric will be available that allows users to add DMA code and location to their reports. For definition, please see the\nLife Data Dictionary\n.\nReport IDs\nAll unique Report IDs have been added to the Reporting UI to enhance troubleshooting. You can view these IDs as follows:\nGenerated Reports List\nScheduled Report Lists:\nWhen expanding list to download or re-run scheduled reports\n.",

      "title": "CPA Optimization User Guide & FAQ",
      "content": "User Guide\nRequired CPA (Cost Per Acquisition) Optimization criteria\n: Following these guidelines will provide the most effective CPA Optimization results.\nUser specific criteria:\nSelf-service, self-service+ and managed service users can access CPA optimization.\nCampaign specific criteria:\nHCP & DTC:\nCPA\nOptimization\nis available for all campaigns .\nA conversion pixel must be placed on the brand site for CPA Optimization to work.\nFAQ\nGeneral\nQ: What is CPA Optimization?\nA\n:\nCPA (Cost Per Acquisition) Optimization automatically prioritizes ad delivery and spend toward HCP and consumer audiences most likely to perform specific actions (determined by where the pixel is placed) on a brand’s website, optimizing conversions and campaign efficiency.\nQ: How does CPA Optimization work?\nA:\nWhen selecting CPA as tactic bidding optimization strategy, set a desired target CPA goal and the desired conversion type via the Conversion Pixel setup tab to manage the cost per conversion. The CPA goal guides the optimization efforts within a campaign to ensure efficient and cost-effective results.\nPulsePoint uses its proprietary conversion prediction model to dynamically adjust bid prices at or lower than the CPA Goal, automatically adjusting bid prices in real time based on the probability of conversion for each potential ad served.\nQ: What is needed for CPA Optimization to work?\nA:\nFirst, Conversion Pixels* must be placed on a brand site page or within the desired action (like a download button) which includes mobile app, website, and/or email environments. Set up the campaign Conversion Pixels following\nthis process\nfor CPA optimizations to work.\n*Note that Conversion Pixels do not collect the information a user inputs into the conversion type, e.g. payment information at checkout or email addresses when filling out a subscription.\nNext, for each action you wish to track,\nassociate its conversion pixel with the tactic's parent line item\n.\nNext, on the Tactic Page, go to the Bid Strategy section within the Campaign Settings tab. From there, select the CPA Optimization bidding strategy, CPA goal, and Conversion Pixel that support each relevant campaign tactic.\nSetting CPA Optimization by Tactic\nStep 1: Select CPA as the Optimization Strategy\nOpen the Optimization Strategy dropdown menu and select CPA.\nStep 2: Set a CPA Goal\nOnce CPA Optimization is selected, the CPA Goal field will appear. Input the maximum cost in dollars for the desired action or acquisition behavior within the CPA Goal field.\nStep 3: Select a Conversion Pixel\nOnce CPA Optimization is selected and the CPA Goal field is filled, a Conversion Pixel field will appear. Select the pixel from the dropdown menu that tracks the event to optimize this tactic for.\nIf the CPA Goal and Conversion Pixel fields have not been completed, a warning will display indicating they must be completed to enable CPA optimization for this tactic.\nQ: What is a Conversion Pixel?\nA:\nConversion pixels are pieces of code that track users who either viewed or clicked an ad, and then subsequently performed a specific action/conversion event on the site the pixel was placed. (e.g., made a purchase, add a product to cart, completed a registration). Specifying a conversion pixel is necessary to ensure that you are tracking the correct action.\nClick\nhere\nfor detailed info.\nQ: What conversion scopes work best with CPA Optimization?\nA:\nConversion Pixels can be set by\nPerson\n,\nDevice\nor\nHousehold\nvia the Scope menu within the Conversion Pixel setup page.\nDevice\nis the ideal scope to use for CPA Optimization, but\nPerson\ncan also be selected.\nHousehold\nis not recommended\n.\nQ: What conversion types work with CPA Optimization?\nA:\nAny brand site\nconversion type\ncan work for CPA optimization, including some of the more common listed below the following screenshot.\nAdd Payment Info\nAdd to Cart\nComplete Registration\nContact\nDownload\nFind Location\nInitiate Checkout\nLead\nPurchase\nRequest Samples\nSearch\nSubmit Application\nSubscribe\nVideo Starts\nView Content\nOther\nNOTE:\nIt is\ncrucial to select the correct conversion type\nwhen implementing a Conversion Pixel. The accuracy of the conversion type data is integral to the functioning of the CPA optimization model.\nQ: Can multiple Conversion Pixels be used for CPA Optimization within a single campaign?\nA:\nMultiple Conversion Pixels may be added to a single campaign, but must be applied to different tactics individually. (e.g. 1 tactic = 1 conversion pixel/CPA goal). For example, different Conversion Pixels can be used to track and drive engagement for tactics focused on different stages of the buyer journey, as seen below:\nTactic/ Pixel 1: Triggered after a user views content on the brand website.\nTactic/ Pixel 2: Activated when a user subscribes to the brand newsletter.\nTactic/ Pixel 3: Triggered when a user downloads brand content.\nTactic/ Pixel 4: Activated when the user makes a purchase.\nIncorporating multiple tactics and Conversion Pixels related to stages of the buyer journey offers greater opportunity for tracking and analyzing audience interactions and enhances the model's ability to optimize campaigns.\nQ: Can a CPA Model be utilized if a Conversion Pixel hasn’t registered any campaign conversions yet?\nA:\nYes. A CPA model is designed to utilize alternative strategies until the number of conversions increases over time, and the model's effectiveness improves as it learns from additional data and conversion events.\nQ: How does CPA Optimization affect bidding?\nA:\nAll bid optimizations generate bid prices from $0.01 to $BaseBid. Only the addition of bid multipliers would increase bids above the $BaseBid. In that case, any bid optimization would be bound by the $MaxBid price defined in Bid Strategy settings.\nA tactic’s budget distribution priority compared to other tactics in a line item does not affect bid pricing.\nQ: What targeting rules work with CPA?\nA:\nAll targeting rules are applicable.\nMeasurement\nQ: How is CPA measured?\nA:\nAs users take action on-site, and the Conversion Pixel fires, conversions are tracked in real-time with line item and tactic attribution within line item metrics. These conversion pixel fires are checked against previous ad exposures, and if a user has been exposed to or clicked through an ad, the underlying line item in Life is awarded a conversion. Conversions are also tracked in Report Builder.\neCPA (effective cost per acquisition) is also measured in real-time based on the volume of Conversion Pixel fires and the overall spend, allowing users to adjust spend towards high performing tactics mid-flight and ultimately achieve conversion goals.\nBest Practices\nQ: How would you suggest setting up my CPA campaigns?\nA:\nAfter building and applying the respective pixels to your activation tactics, the Platform team recommends running your campaign with a cost per (i.e. CPM) optimization strategy through the launch phase. This will allow the platform to optimize towards cost while understanding your conversion behavior. Once there is a statistically significant amount of delivery (i.e. 50-100 pixel fires to start), users can pull reporting and calculate CPA, and use that as a starting point for CPA optimization inputs.\nQ: What if my client doesn’t have a target CPA goal in mind or readily available?\nA:\nIt is recommended to launch the campaign with a cost per or reach optimization strategy in-place in order to get a baseline starting point.\nQ: Can I just set the CPA goal once at launch and set it and forget it? How often and when should I reevaluate my CPA goal?\nA:\nCost per conversion performance of the campaign should be evaluated at the same cadence as any other optimized KPIs, whether that is weekly, monthly or quarterly, and may depend on the goal and budget of the campaign. Users are free to adjust the target CPA goal after the first few readouts and once there is greater understanding of live campaign performance.\nCPA goals should be reviewed when any activation shifts are made within the campaigns, most notably asset changes (i.e. investment redistribution from Display to Video), website updates, or creative swaps.\nQ: Roughly how much lower should I set my CPA target compared to my actual cost/conversion average from reporting?\nA:\nSetting a CPA goal up to 2x higher than the desired CPA may be a good starting point, but will depend on campaign nuances and set-up. Please consult your PSM to discuss the best CPA strategy for your campaign.\nQ: What if my client has multiple priorities for the campaign (CTR, CPC, and CPA). What should I recommend to them?\nA:\nWhen working with optimization strategies and campaign KPIs, it is imperative to have one KPI as the focus for optimizations in order to meet client goals. In this case, the CPA bid strategy will focus on driving conversions, which may or may not have an impact on other performance metrics like CPM or CTR. If there are ongoing conversations about prioritization, it is okay to encourage the selection of the primary KPI as the one that the campaign will automatically optimize towards, while still using manual reporting & optimizations to achieve secondary KPI goals.",

They must login to Komodo to access reports.\nCampaign specific criteria\n:\nDTC\nOnly:\nQualified Audience Reach scores in Life and Komodo dashboards are available for DTC campaigns only.\nLive campaigns only:\nA DTC campaign must be live to measure results. DTC Insights will only measure campaign data once it’s configured for a current and or new campaign.\nTier 1 -\nQualified Audience Reach\nValidate intended audiences reached through daily Qualified Audience Reach scores.\nQualified Audience Reach Scores in Life:\nDescription:\nQualified Audience Reach (QAR) scores provide daily visibility into the % of intended audiences exposed as defined by the brand and qualified by diagnosed patient pools from Komodo’s Healthcare Map.\nQAR is calculated by the # of exposed patients who have the condition of interest divided by the # of total exposed patients.\nQAR scores are broken down by the following elements:\nLine item\nFlight\nTactic\nThe Qualified Audience Reach score tab is visible by line item in Overview metrics in Life. The top AQ score shown in the tab is the average score of all tactics in a line item combined.\nFunction:\nUsers can validate DTC campaign reach and targeting strategy accuracy.\nAvailable filters:\nQualified Audience Reach\nmeasures can be filtered by line item and tactic.\nUsers can choose to view scores as a cumulative measure or start at zero. The default is both.\nCumulative QAR is an additive metric that shows QAR for a given line item or tactic over time.\nThe adjacent Komodo logo links to the client’s external Tier 2 and Tier 3 Komodo dashboards (explained in detail under Frequently Asked Questions below). If Tier 2 and 3 dashboards are not enabled, the Komodo logo has no link.\nData refresh:\nOnce a campaign is live, Qualified Audience Reach metrics will be visible 2 days post-launch. Users will see a message in-platform indicating when Qualified Audience Reach is turned on but needs time to ramp up.\nDuring a campaign, metrics are updated daily.\nA minimum of 100 exposed individuals who fall within a cohort in a given time period is needed for QAR scores to populate. A QAR score of 0 indicates that the campaign did not reach at least 100 exposed individuals who fell within the cohort in a given time period.  A daily QAR may never reach 100+, but the moving 7-day QAR or cumulative QAR likely will.\nTier 2 -\nTrend Analytics\nIdentify campaign-driven peaks in weekly Dx, Rx and Tx trends for exposed audiences and drill into high-performing channels, ad frequency and demographics. Trend Analytics i\nncludes enhanced Qualified Audience Reach Scores, Source of Business, Audience Profiling and Measurement & Efficiency dashboards.\nQualified Audience Reach Scores within Komodo:\nDescription:\nIn addition to Qualified Audience Reach scores in Life, DTC Trend Analytics offers enhanced weekly scoring in Komodo, including diagnosis and conversion rates post-exposure.\nQualified Audience Reach definitions:\nQualified Audience Reach Weekly Average\n:\nweekly scoring of the % of intended audiences reached throughout DTC campaigns\nQualified Audience Reach Longer Term Trends:\na daily AQ, 7 day look back and upper and lower bounds metrics to detect outliers when comparing targeting strategy efficacy over time\nQualified Audience Reach by Line Item Type:\nweekly\nAQ scoring for channel efficacy by intended diagnosis over time\nTotal Individuals Exposed\n:\na count of all individuals exposed, not uniques\nTotal Diagnosed Individuals from Exposed Population:\na count of all individuals exposed (not uniques) with the target diagnosis\nHeart Failure was the target diagnosis example in the demo screenshot above\nby Target Diagnosis Status at First Exposure\n:\npercentages of all individuals exposed with the target diagnosis at first exposure to an ad.

For example, if I have a campaign for insulin A and my campaign strategy is to steal share from insulin B, then I can assess the impact of the advertising in driving NBRx and see where this is coming from. Was the patient treatment naïve or, were they previously on insulin B prior to exposure and then switched to insulin A post exposure?\nSource of Business Definitions:\nFull SoB Report:\nclinical behavior counts based on monthly cohorts of intended audiences exposed\nNo therapy\n:\nexposed individuals not filling target or competitor Rx\nDiscontinued\n: patients who discontinued target or competitor Rx for at least 30 days\nNBRx\n:\npatients who just started the target Rx, who are maintaining the Rx, and who restarted the Rx after a +12 mo hiatus\nRestarted\n: patients who restarted the Rx within the past 12 mo\nRefilled\n: patients who refilled the Rx\nOn therapy\n: patients who are adhering to the Rx\nNon-adherent\n: patients who discontinued target Rx within the last 30 days\nOn competitor\n: patients on competitor Rx\nSwitch from\n: patients who switched from competitor Rx to target Rx (competitive conquest)\nSwitch to\n: patients who switched to competitor Rx from target Rx\nOn Therapy Distribution for Current Month Across all Cohorts\n:\na clinical behavior bar chart visual across all cohorts during the current month\nCumulative Conversion and Persistence Metrics Over Campaign Across All Cohorts\n:\na clinical behavior line graph visual across all cohorts during the entire campaign, updated weekly\nData refresh:\nOnce a campaign is live, metrics will be visible a month post-launch.\nDuring a campaign, metrics are updated monthly.\nMeasurement & Efficiency:\nDescription:\nDTC Trend Analytics’ Measurement & Efficiency dashboard gives weekly visibility into ad frequency's effect on brand conversion.\nFunction:\nUsers can improve conversion rates mid-flight by tailoring ad frequency to higher engagement trends.\nConversion Definitions:\nConversion by Temporal Cohort:\nmeasures cohorts of individuals with new prescriptions from the month that each cohort was exposed\nConversion by Temporal Cohort (Time Aligned):\nmeasures cohorts of individuals with new prescriptions from the start of each campaign regardless of the calendar month\nTotal Exposed by Frequency:\nmeasures ad frequency and individuals exposed\nTotal Conversion by Frequency:\nmeasures ad frequency and individuals with new prescriptions post-exposure\nConversion Rate by Frequency:\nmeasures ad frequency and conversion rates for individuals with new prescriptions post-exposure\nData refresh:\nOnce a campaign is live, metrics will be visible a week post-launch.\nDuring a campaign, metrics are updated weekly.\nTier 3 -\nFull-View Script Lift\nCompare target therapy conversions for exposed and unexposed patient segments on a monthly basis with advanced test and control methodologies.\nIncluding Trend Analytics’ Qualified Audience Reach Scores, Source of Business, and Audience Profiling dashboards PLUS Segmentation & Treatment Journey and enhanced Measurement & Efficiency dashboards.\nSegmentation & Treatment Journey:\nDescription:\nDTC Full-View Script Lift’s Segmentation & Treatment Journey dashboard gives monthly visibility into test and control analyses for clinical behavior post-exposure by individuals exposed (campaign) and unexposed (control) based on Komodo’s Healthcare Map.\nFunction:\nUsers gain deep insight into patient journeys 12/mo post-exposure and can optimize campaign strategy mid-flight to increase specialist visits, diagnoses, new target prescriptions and competitive conquesting.\nSegmentation & Treatment Journey Definitions:\nPost-Exposure Reaction\n: a test and control analysis of the clinical events of all individuals exposed by intended individuals exposed (campaign) and unexposed (control).\nUsers define patient journey reactions based on their brand attributes\nUsers may also filter the data by target diagnosis status at exposure\nPercent with Any Reaction\n:\nthe total percentage of reactions for intended individuals exposed (campaign) and unexposed (control)\nCampaign Lift by Exposure Reaction\n:\nmeasures lift and/ or drops in patient reactions for intended individuals exposed (campaign) and unexposed (control)\nPayer Mix of Exposed Population:\nmeasures the various payer types that reimbursed\nindividuals exposed for target treatment, e.g. medical/ drug claims\nPayer Mix of Individuals with New Prescriptions:\nmeasures the various payer types that reimbursed individuals exposed with new target prescriptions\nSite of Care for New Prescriptions:\nmeasures the type of facility associated with the prescribing HCP for intended individuals exposed with new target prescriptions\nNew Competitor Prescriptions Post-Exposure:\nmeasures new competitor prescriptions versus new target prescriptions post-exposure for intended individuals exposed (campaign) and unexposed (control)\nThis graph displays the amount of individuals that received Rx for the client's defined 'Competitor(s)' following their initial exposure to the campaign, compared to a Control group. Generally, the insights in this chart should prompt a larger conversation around conversion, strategy, and optimization. The additional charts/insights within the Dashboard can help to reveal more context behind what the client sees in “New Competitor Prescriptions Post-Exposure” You wouldn’t necessarily know if drug switches are taking place from this graph alone, however SoB would give more visibility into drug switching/newly prescribed patients.\nSpecialist Appointments in Year Post-Engagement (Campaign):\nthe percentage of individuals exposed (campaign) who did or did not see a specialist in the year after seeing an ad\nSpecialist Appointments in Year Post-Engagement (Control)\n:\nthe percentage of individuals unexposed (control) who did or did not see a specialist in the year after seeing an ad\nFirst Specialist Seen in the Year Post-Engagement:\na test and control analysis of the various types of first specialists seen by intended individuals exposed (campaign) and unexposed (control) in the year after seeing an ad. Users define specialists based on their brand attributes\nData refresh:\nOnce a campaign is live, metrics will be visible a month post-launch.\nDuring a campaign, metrics are updated monthly\nMeasurement & Efficiency enhanced\n:\nDescription:\nDTC Full-View Script Lift’s Measurement & Efficiency dashboard gives monthly visibility into test and control analyses for conversion rates (e.g. script lift) post-exposure by individuals exposed (campaign) and unexposed (control) based on Komodo’s Healthcare Map.\nFunction:\nUsers can accredit script lift to specific campaigns, channels and monthly timelines to discover direct and indirect campaign influences and improve conversion rates.\nMeasurement & Efficiency Definitions:\nTotal Individuals Reached\n: a total count of the audience reached\nPopulation with New Prescription Post Exposure\n:\na test and control count of new prescriptions, scripts due to switches from and scripts due to restarts post-exposure by intended individuals exposed (campaign) and unexposed (control)\nPercent of Population with New Prescription Post Exposure\n:\na test and control percentage of new prescriptions post-exposure by intended individuals exposed (campaign) and unexposed (control)\nTotal Exposed by Frequency\n:\nmeasures ad frequency and individuals exposed\nTotal Conversion by Frequency\n:\nmeasures ad frequency and individuals with new prescriptions post-exposure\nConversion Rate by Frequency\n:\nmeasures ad frequency and conversion rates for individuals with new prescriptions post-exposure\nConversion by Temporal Cohort\n:\nmeasures cohorts of individuals with new prescriptions from the month that each cohort was exposed\nConversion by Temporal Cohort (Time Aligned\n):\nmeasures cohorts of individuals with new prescriptions from the start of each campaign regardless of the calendar month\nCumulative Conversion vs. Randomized Control Population\nOverall Cumulative Conversion (Time Aligned)\n:\na test and control analysis of cohorts of individuals with new prescriptions by the cumulative intended individuals exposed (campaign) and unexposed (control) from the start of each campaign regardless of the calendar month\nCumulative Conversion - Sep 2021 Cohort\n:\na test and control analysis of cohorts of individuals with new prescriptions by intended individuals exposed (campaign) and unexposed (control) from the month that each cohort was exposed\nSummary of Campaign Performance\n:\na comprehensive overview of campaign performance by channel type, cost, reach, expected revenue, ROI and more, updated quarterly\nLine Item Type\n: the tactics used in a campaign by line item which is pulled directly from Life\nProperty cost\n: campaign expenses by line item\nWeighted contribution\n: a percentage of probability that a line item drove conversions\nKomodo uses Markov Chain attribution model which estimates the marginal contribution of each channel by calculating the probability that conversion occurs as a function of the multitude of exposure pathways, taking into account the order of channel exposure\nGross attributed individuals\n:\na count of all exposed individuals who converted by line item, calculated by multiplying Weighted contribution and Gross Conversion Count in Exposed Population\nNet attributed individuals\n: a count of all exposed individuals who converted by line item, minus unexposed individuals with new prescriptions in the control group, calculated by multiplying Weighted contribution and Net Conversion Count\nUnexposed individuals in the control group are counted because they may start the target therapy naturally during the campaign time frame, without having ever seen an ad\nNote that Net calculations may not always show positive ROI and in fact show negative ROI in cases where brands may not be targeting the right audience demographics. Clients should be encouraged to revise targeting criteria, such as adding more resources to high performing  audience demographics and channels\nNet expected revenue\n: expected revenue for every line item calculated by the number of Net attributed individuals multiplied by customer lifetime value\nNet cost per NPS\n: cost per NPS (new patient starts) for every line item calculated by the Property cost per line item divided by the number of net attributed individuals\nNet ROI\n: return on investment percentage calculated by the Net expected revenue divided by the Property cost per line item\nNet ROI ratio\n: a numerical representation of Net ROI\nP-value\n:\na statistical test evaluating a line item’s effect on conversion. P-values less than 0.05 are considered statistically significant which indicates that there is a low likelihood of results occurring naturally without campaign influence, and therefore, higher Net ROI.\nMethodology\n: For each campaign, Komodo dollarizes the impact of the media spend by multiplying the projected number of patients who converted (or other primary endpoint) by the expected \"lifetime value\" per patient.  For multi-channel campaigns, the projected number of patients who converted is estimated by running a Markov attribution algorithm which isolates the impact of each channel's spend regardless of how that channel was/was not used in combination with other channels. ROI is then calculated by dividing the expected total revenue by the media spend per channel\nGross Conversion Count in Exposed Population\n:\na count of exposed individuals with new prescriptions, updated quarterly\nNet Conversion Count\n:\na count of exposed individuals with new prescriptions, minus unexposed individuals with new prescriptions in the control group, updated quarterly\nUnexposed individuals in the control group are counted because they may start the target therapy naturally during the campaign time frame, without having ever seen an ad\nNote that Net calculations may not always show positive ROI and in fact show negative ROI in cases where brands may not be targeting the right audience demographics. Clients should be encouraged to revise targeting criteria, such as adding more resources to high performing audience demographics and channels\nReach Summary\n:\nreach metrics by line item type, updated quarterly\nUnique Individuals\n: unique individuals reached by line item type\nUnique Diagnosed Individuals\n:\nunique individuals reached with the target diagnosis by line item type\n% Diagnosed\n: the percentage of Unique Individuals reached with the target diagnosis  by line item type\nCampaign Efficiency\n:\nan audience quality analysis for every line item calculated by % Diagnosed divided by Property cost, updated quarterly\nIn this bubble graph view, the bigger the bubble, the greater the reach. Big bubbles  close to the top of the y-axis and close to the left on the x-axis imply high reach and high audience quality achieved at low cost\nAvailable filters:\nResults can be filtered by age, gender, or disease severity, which users define based on the brand\nData refresh:\nOnce a campaign is live, metrics will be visible a month post-launch.\nDuring a campaign, metrics are updated monthly.\nFAQ\nGeneral\nQ: Are these measurements available for HCP campaigns?\nA\n:\nNo, DTC only. The Qualified Audience Reach tab will not be visible in HCP campaign metrics.\nQ: Are these measurements available for all programmatic media or just Life media?\nA\n:\nLife media only.\nQ: Where on the dashboards are the cohorts outlined\nA\n:\nCohort Condition of interest is visible above the chart tabs as a sub-header, for example “Prostate Cancer” featured below. In the Filter tab on the left, users can select cohorts by first month exposed and filter by age, gender, etc.\nTier setup/ switch, RFPs\nQ: What is required in order for Qualified Audience Reach Tier 1 to be set up?\nA\n:\nWithin inactive QAR score tabs in line item metrics dashboards, users will see descriptions for each DTC Insights tier and instructions to contact their Account Manager (AM) to set up the desired tier.\nBased on a client’s request, AMs then enable measurement.\nWorking with account executives to gather cohort information\n, AMs will provide a list of condition cohorts for a client to choose from. Once chosen, AMs will enable cohort measurement for the appropriate tier, making QAR scores available in line item metrics dashboards.\nOnce a campaign is live, Qualified Audience Reach metrics will be visible a few days post-launch. Users will see a message in-platform indicating when Qualified Audience Reach is turned on, but needs time to ramp up. A minimum of 100 exposed individuals who fall within a cohort in a given time period is needed for QAR scores to populate. A QAR score of 0 indicates that the campaign did not reach at least 100 exposed individuals who fell within the cohort in a given time period.  A daily QAR may never reach 100+, but the moving 7-day QAR or cumulative QAR likely will.\nQ: What is required on PulsePoint’s side to set up Tier 2 or 3 post-sale?\nA\n:\nBased on a client’s request, AMs will submit a Komodo intake form with Tier 2 or 3 selected based on specific questions. Working with account executives to gather cohort information\n, AMs will then provide a list of condition cohorts for a client to choose from. Once chosen, AMs will enable cohort measurement for the appropriate tier, making QAR scores available in line item metrics dashboards.\nOnce enabled, measurement and billing will begin upon campaign launch.\nUsers can access Tier 2 or 3 dashboards outside of Life through custom dashboards in Komodo’s platform.\nQ: What is the process for switching tiers mid campaign?\nA\n:\nTiers can be upgraded but cannot be downgraded. In short, we would treat any upgrade as a new campaign.\nPlease submit an intake form for the upgraded tier request according to the agreed upon SLAs. You will receive a new dashboard for the upgraded tier on the 1st of the month due to CPM changes and measurement read out.\nIf you’d like to capture the retroactive data from the lower tier in the upgraded tier, there may be additional cost. Your sales rep can reach out to Komodo partners to discuss pricing.\nQ: If you sign up for Full-View Script Lift Tier 3 does this also give you visibility to Trends Analytics Tier 2 and Qualified Audience Reach Tier 1 dashboards too? If you sign up for Trends Analytics Tier 2 does this also give you visibility to the Qualified Audience Reach Tier 1 dashboard?\nA\n:\nYes\nData refresh, lag\nQ: What is implementation time from requesting access to Tier 1, 2 or 3 and getting visibility to results?\nA\n:\nQualified Audience Reach scores will be visible approximately five business days after proper intake form submission with all required client data and other client /market-related inputs. For Trend Analytics Tier 2, the dashboards will go live about 15 days after proper intake form submission. For Full-View Script Lift Tier 3, data is delivered on a monthly basis, and thus the required customer data to begin delivery would be a month’s worth of data after proper intake form submission.\nQ: How often are the charts refreshed post implementation?\nA\n:\nCharts are updated daily for Qualified Audience Reach, weekly for Trend Analytics and monthly for Full-View Script Lift. Weekly metrics will be refreshed on each Wednesday following delivery. Monthly metrics will be refreshed on the 3rd business day of each month following delivery. During monthly refreshes, weekly metrics will also be refreshed to keep everything consistent, so at the beginning of each month, you may have two refreshes within one week.\nQ: Will DTC Insights backtrack past campaign data?\nA\n:\nNo, DTC Insights will only measure campaign data once it’s configured for a new campaign.\nReporting\nQ: Will users have back end access for Tiers 2 and 3 and flexibility to do custom reporting?\nA\n:\nBackend access is not covered with the tiered PulsePoint offerings. If customers wish to expand their access, they can work directly with Komodo to contract for additional “backend” access to the joined data in a secure environment. Likewise, if custom reporting is desired, they can open a discussion with Komodo regarding scope, timing, and fees. Please reach out to your sales representative to be connected with our Komodo partners.\nQ: Does every user decide how frequently they want each report? Which do or don’t have flexibility in terms of data refresh and or reporting frequency?\nA\n:\nCustom report frequency and data refresh dates are not available at this time. Users must return to the dashboard to view updates.\nCompetitive differentiation\nQ: What differentiates Komodo’s clinical data?\nA\n:\nKomodo’s clinical data is 70% based on payer completes from Rx fills as a primary signal, rather than open claims as the major input which has 30-90-day delays from insurance payments as a primary signal.\nQ: What level of competitive insight will we have (alternative treatments considered)?\nA\n:\nClients will define the competitors to measure against during onboarding. Tier 2 & 3 give monthly visibility into patient therapy behavior, with both target and competitor scripts, for cohorts of exposed audiences 12 months post-exposure. Competitor metrics include: patients currently on competitor treatment, patients who switched from competitor treatment to target script, patients who switched to competitor treatment from target script, and comparisons between new competitor and target prescriptions post-exposure based on exposed and unexposed audiences within Tier 3 Full-View Script Lift’s Segmentation & Treatment Journey tab.\nChannel measurement, CTV\nQ: What channels can be measured, e.g. d\nisplay, video, native\nand CTV?\nA\n:\nClients can tag most channels utilized in Life that they want to track, except DOOH and audio. DTC Insights covers CTV, search, social, print, and\noffice, with a limit of up to 20 groupings.\nQ: Does Komodo provide visibility to multi-touch attribution?\nA\n:\nKomodo’s default is Markov Chain attribution for multi-channel campaigns and is the methodology used in Tier 3. The Markov approach is an iterative algorithm that creates a consumer “graph” (Markov chain) to map out not only the various combinations of channels that consumers are exposed to, but also the order and any potential channel “re-exposure loops” (e.g., site A > site B > site A > site C). The Markov approach estimates the marginal contribution of each channel by calculating the probability that conversion occurs as a function of the multitude of exposure pathways.\nClinical/ claims data\nQ: Does DTC Insights\nmeasure claims data beyond scripts, e.g. CPT codes, medical devices\n?\nA\n:\nClients can tag any clinical trigger they want to track, e.g. a med device's category or brand specific HCPCS, J-Code, NDC, Rx or CPT code. Exact codes can be provided upon request to your AM or PSM.\nQ: Can your platform measure buy-n-bills meds? How does your platform account for buy-n-bill meds?\nA\n:\nIf we consider that most buy and bill meds are SP drugs, due to the amount of sources of data Komodo partners with, we do have SP Rx capture, beyond what a typical aggregator would see. Moreso, on the Mx side than the Rx side. So if the drug is J-Coded (J-Codes primarily identify injectable drugs that ordinarily cannot be self-administered, chemotherapy drugs, and some orally administered drugs) we’ll likely have the heaviest capture as these are captured in Mx claims. We can easily leverage Prism to see capture on a drug by drug basis.\nFor buy and bill specifically, it's hard to tell directly but we can make inferences based on the pharmacy NPI. For example, if you saw an infusion drug at a pharmacy claim vs the medical claim side, it could be because of buy and bill since infusion drugs are usually on the Mx side.\nQ: Will the partnered solution address the complete patient journey, from Rx, speciality pharma, clinical, EHR/EMR, Payer, Lab, Hospital, HCPs, and HCOs?\nA\n:\nYes, with 2 exceptions: Komodo does not have EHR/ EMR data and lab results would be an additional request/ fee. Data from all available sources is incorporated into all tiers. However, only Tier 3 will show more specific insights on the patient journey, regarding HCPs, payer, place of service, etc.\nQAR scores, codes, benchmarks\nQ: Can I customize the condition codes I want to measure QAR against? How can I know what ICD-10s QAR scores are measuring against?\nA\n:\nQAR in Life is an off the shelf cohort with no customization. Tier 2 and 3 QAR scores are customizable with\nclients providing desired ICD10 codes in intake forms.\nQ: What methodology was used to define which codes are applicable to which drugs? Can PP provide more insight as to how patient definitions are developed in cases where ICD10 is not cut & dry?\nA\n:\nOur methodology is based on Komodo’s Healthcare Map and AMs touch base with Komodo’s Clinical team for their recommendations on what the best ICD10 codes are for certain conditions (e.g. seasonal allergies or drug allergies).\nQ: What would be an anticipated range or benchmark for AQ scores that I could expect to see to ensure results are within the realm of normal or outperforming? What action should/could I take when I see below normal performance results?\nA\n:\nQualified Audience Reach scores are unique to every therapeutic area and the media plan for that specific campaign. There are no industry benchmarks to compare scores with, but rather a brand’s own high, low and average AQ scores throughout campaign lifecycles. Within Full-View Script Lift’s Conversion tab, users can compare campaign target demographics with subsequent Rx demographics for individuals that started Rx after exposure. These insights can be used to better define location, gender and age criteria to improve performance and AQ scores of current and future DTC campaigns.\nQ: Can I identify QAR scores (how many consumers are likely to be diagnosed) across various channels pre-campaign launch?\nA\n:\nNo. QAR scores (and all DTC Insights tiers) are only available post-campaign launch.\nQ: Can I see the cost to reach the diagnosed population and the cost to convert new patients pre-campaign launch?\nA\n:\nNo. We cannot provide QAR scores or audiences before campaign launch, so we cannot figure out the exact costs to reach those qualified audiences or convert new patients pre-launch.\nCompliance, deduping data, privacy\nQ: How does Komodo ensure HIPAA compliance, e.g. the process for de-id tokenization and linkage?\nA\n:\nKomodo collects de-identified data from a variety of different sources, primarily at the claim level, and they use a 3P service to tokenize. They have a token for every single patient regardless of what source they came from. Data is cleaned, normalized and de-duped while ensuring it can stitch together a longitudinal history for every single patient. Post normalization, it is linked back at the token level.\nQ: How does Komodo manage deduping of data?\nA\n:\nTo level set, ‘Patient’ is defined as individuals who receive healthcare services and/or products that trigger a Visit. Komodo de-identifies and de-duplicates information about these individuals. A ‘Visit’ is a single billable interaction between a unique patient and HCP on a specific day. Komodo de-duplicates claims for all data partners to accurately represent this single billable interaction.\nC\nontact info for more questions\nQ: Who should I reach out to for a question that’s not covered here?\nA\n:\nFor Life related questions, please first contact your AM and/ or PSM.\nFor PulsePoint Prism Users, if you have questions or technical issues in Prism, please submit a request in the Customer Request Portal (? icon in Prism > Contact Us).\nFor questions about pricing, please contact your Sales Manager.",

      "content": "User Guide\nRequired Curated Markets Criteria\n:\nFollowing these guidelines will provide the most effective results when Curated Markets are leveraged for campaign execution.\nUser specific criteria:\nSelf-service, self-service+ and managed service users can access and run Curated Market supply on all relevant campaign tactics. Contact your PulsePoint representative to learn what Curated Market supply will best support your campaign performance goals and objectives.\nCampaign specific criteria:\nHCP & DTC:\nCurated Markets are built to optimize HCP and/or DTC campaign performance outcomes and KPI achievement.\nFAQ\nActivation\nQ: What are Curated Markets?\nA\n: Curated Markets provide in-platform access to ready-to-activate, pre-negotiated supply, strategically assembled to optimize campaign goal achievement.\nYou can readily activate an existing Curated Market in PulsePoint's platform, or custom-curate your own Curated Market via your PulsePoint support team.\nQ: What are the benefits of PulsePoint’s Curated Markets?\nA\n: Curated Markets provide direct access to a compilation of pre-negotiated, high-performing supply tailored to meet specific campaign performance goals (e.g., display engagement).\nUnlike advertiser-sourced PMPs, Curated Markets contain supply that is sourced, negotiated, and maintained directly between the platform and publisher, eliminating the need to manually negotiate each deal yourself. PulsePoint leverages its publisher and supply-side relationships and buying power to secure high-performing supply that drive specific outcomes for health marketers.\nOnce Curated Markets are activated within a campaign, performance data (e.g., CTR, Viewability, Video Completion Rate) are reviewed daily by PulsePoint, allowing for ongoing optimizations and adjustments to be made automatically to sites and inventory to ensure campaign KPIs, pacing, and spend goals are achieved.\nQ: What Curated Markets are available in the platform today?\nA:\nThe following Curated Markets are available for immediate activation within the sub-market categories below:\nPerformance Markets:\nSupply that is specifically optimized to achieve desired campaign KPIs (Engagement [CTR], Viewability [70%+], Video Completion Rate).\nChannel and Contextual Markets:\nChannel-specific and contextual supply packaged to streamline inventory access and activation, especially for highly fragmented supply or contextual definitions that requires a higher level of vetting (CTV/OTT, Sports, Women-Owned, Minority-Owned, Hispanic Content, LGBTQ Content, Spanish Language).\nEndemic Markets:\nReadily available supply across premium\nEHRs\nfor reaching physicians.\nCampaign-Specific Markets:\nCustom, brand-curated supply inclusive of multiple publishers:\nSelf-Service/Self-Service+:\nUpon request, supply can be custom-curated for a specific campaign objective and be accessible in the platform for activation, exclusively for your account. Self-Service/Self-Service+ users can select Campaign-Specific Market criteria in\nthis sheet.\nManaged Service:\nUpon request,\ns\nupply can be custom-curated for a specific campaign objective based on PulsePoint campaign manager recommendations. Any supply custom-curated for managed service users may be made available in the platform for general access.\nMore details on each market, including KPI baselines and suggested floor price and bid ranges, can be found in\nthis sheet.\nQ: What makes PulsePoint Curated Markets unique?\nA\n: PulsePoint works with supply-side partners and publishers to curate inventory pools with data or other signals so that the most relevant inventory reaches campaign tactics. We expanded supplier relationships to enhance transparency and to gain access to untapped inventory in a more efficient feedback loop.\nSimultaneously, our DSP continues to optimize based on the campaign's defined success metric.\nQ: What is needed to activate Curated Markets?\nA\n: Since Performance, Channel, and Endemic Curated Markets are readily available, no additional setup is required.\nThese Markets are accessible within the\nPremium Publishers\ntargeting rule menu as seen below. To activate:\nCreate a line item and tactic following the standard campaign setup process.\nOnce a tactic is set, navigate to the\nDeals Table\n.\nNOTE\n- Only the Curated Markets applicable to the line item type chosen during line item and tactic setup will appear (e.g., display deals only show for display tactics).\nFilter by\nLife Marketplace Deals\n. (A\n↓\n)\nSearch for\nppmarket\nto view all relevant deals for the chosen tactic creative type. (B↑)\nClick\nto apply deal to tactic. (C\n↑\n)\nConfirm that the\nOnly Target Applied Deals\ntoggle is enabled. (D\n↑\n)\nClick\nat bottom of Deals Table.\nSave tactic.\nUpon request, Campaign-Specific Markets can be defined based on available\nmarket criteria\n. Requests should be made via your PulsePoint Account Manager for managed service users or Platform Solutions Managers for self-service/self-service+ users. This process takes apx. three to four weeks to turn around. When available, Campaign-Specific Markets will appear within your UI with the indicator\nPPMarket\nin the\nDeals Table\n. Self-service/self-service+ users will be emailed the exact name by their Platform Solutions Manager upon availability.\nQ: What is the best way to forecast Curated Market performance?\nA\n: Because campaign-level targeting is different for every campaign, the PulsePoint team supporting the rollout of Curated Markets maintains\nthis sheet\n(column D) with the last 30 days average avails in order to provide the best estimate for real-time campaign performance.\nQ: Do all targeting rules, bidding optimizations, etc. work with Curated Markets?\nA\n: Yes. All of the best-in-class capabilities available in the Life DSP, including targeting, optimization strategies, etc., are applicable to Curated Markets.\nHowever, it is important to understand that because of a bi-directional feedback loop with supply partners, there is some dynamism with the supply in Curated Markets, unless you activate a market with specifically defined inventory (such as Minority-Owned or Women-Owned content).\nThe recommended best practice is to target Curated Markets (excluding Markets with specifically defined inventory such as the above) and hold off on domain/app level optimizations until you achieve a baseline KPI that aligns with the market benchmark range. Benchmark ranges are provided for markets in the\ndeals sheet\n.\n>\nEXAMPLE\n-\nCTR should be between the range of\n0.08% - 0.15%\n.\nIf the benchmark is not being achieved or an advertiser would like to see increased performance above and beyond the baseline, you should:\nPerform domain- and app- level optimizations in the DSP and block supply that is on the lower end of performance,\nIf needed or desired, reach out to your PulsePoint Account Manager to create a custom market specifically curated for their needs.\nQ: Do NPI Smart Lists\nTM\nwork with Curated Markets?\nA\n: Yes.\nNPI Smart Lists\ncan be used with Curated Markets as you can with any other supply activated in the platform. If scale is an issue through this precision targeting tactic, your Account Manager and Campaign Manager will work with you to increase it.\nQ: Are all devices, channels, and creative types applicable for Curated Markets?\nA\n: DOOH as a channel is not available yet. Trigger Email, and Social channels cannot be activated within Curated Markets or other PMPs given the difference in inventory type within these channels.\nQ: How is MFA inventory blocked through Curated Markets?\nA\n: PulsePoint blocks MFA (Made-for-Advertising) inventory proactively at the DSP platform level through our various technology partners integrations and human processes. Accordingly, the same controls are in place and applicable to the supply that is in Curated Markets.\nQ: What Creative Specs are compatible with the Native Display Market?\nA:\nAsset Format: Native Display Main Image Sizes of:\n300x250\n320x50\n728x90\n300x600\n160x600\n970x250\nIncluding Support of Native Components in Life DSP:\nHeadline\nSponsored By\nDescription\nDisplay URL\nLogo Image\nAdChoices Icon\nAdditional Supported Format: Standard Display Sizes (listed below) can run on our Native Display inventory without requiring Native Components, providing a seamless and efficient way to leverage existing Standard Display creatives.\n300x250\n320x50\n728x90\n300x600\n160x600\n970x250\nMeasurement\nQ: Is Curated Markets measurement available in the platform?\nA:\nYes. Measurement for Curated Markets is available in Life\nReport Builder\n, and traditional dimensions associated with supply performance are available, such as\nDomain, App Bundle, Device Type,\nCreative Type\n.\nPost-activation, Self-Service users will have visibility into the deals inside each Curated Market. The recommended reporting dimension to use (along with any others you require) is\nPMP Name\nto see the associated sub-marketplace, as seen below.\nQ: How can I test Curated Market performance?\nA:\nTo compare Curated Market supply with traditional PMP deals, create two identical tactics with the exact same targeting parameters. Then, in the\nPremium Publishers\ntargeting rule, you should then only target Curated Market supply on one of the tactics, and traditional PMPs on the other. Post-activation, measure each tactic’s performance with appropriate metrics in Life Report Builder against the campaign goal(s) to determine the efficacy of Curated Markets vs. traditional PMPs. Click\nhere\nfor more info.\nIf certain publisher(s) within a Curated Market are not performing, you should optimize the Curated Market at the domain and/or app level (meaning choose to block certain low performing domains and apps in the\nDomains/Apps\ntargeting rule). If combining domain- and app-level optimizations with other standard targeting optimizations does not improve Curated Market performance, contact your PulsePoint account representative so they can help you customize a campaign-specific Curated Market.\nQ: Are beta stats available?\nA:\nYes.\nKPI baselines based on internal testing can be found in column E of\nthis sheet\n.\nCompetitive Advantage\nQ: Are PulsePoint’s Curated Markets available on other platforms?\nA:\nPulsePoint Curated Markets are the only curated supply product in the market focused on driving health marketer outcomes. We have exclusive supply partnerships underpinning Curated Markets not available to our main competitors.",

The reporting output will specifically read “UniqueDevices”.\nPipe Delimited File Format\nA new CSV file format option is now available with pipe delimiters.\nCustom Fields Categorization\nCustom fields at the campaign, line item and tactic level are now categorized in Report Builder reporting templates.\nUnique Key Per Row\nUsers can now add a unique key for each row of a report that represents the row number.\nInternal Only\nBespoke audience net price update\nNet price for all Bespoke audiences will automatically be set to $0.\nExternal Beta\nSimplify Cookieless Targeting & DTC Testing\nThe user interface for cookieless targeting has been streamlined to a straightforward yes/no selection option.

      "content": "HCP365 - GTM\nSite Pixel\nImplementation Guide\nTable of Contents\nImplementing your HCP365 Site Pixel\nHCP365 Pixel Variables & Parameters\nSetting Up Your Trigger From GTM’s Main Page\nResources\nHCP365 IMPLEMENTATION IN GOOGLE TAG MANAGER\nLast Updated: June 2025\nThe following documentation was created for the purpose of assisting you with your site tag setup. Assuming you already have a GTM account that is configured  for tag implementation, you are free to being setting up your HCP365 Site Pixel!\n**EXTREMELY IMPORANT TO CONSIDER**\nIn the event that you decide to change your site tag setup by migrating to a different platform like Tealium or Adobe, please run this by your Account Manager first and ask for a revised tag or tags that are compatible with those platforms.\nAttempting to make custom changes to your HCP365 Google Site Tag can result in data not populating correctly in reporting as well as other issues that we have seen!\nImplementing your HCP365 Site Pixel:\nOnce your Account is set up and you have your new container designated for the webpage you want your pixel to fire on, be sure to refer back to the pixel documentation presented to you by your account manager to make sure that you are implementing the correct pixel.\nPrior to setting anything up in GTM, please make sure you are implementing the correct pixel as per the Collection/ Advertiser info listed on the HCP365 site pixel document which will be provided to you by your PulsePoint Account Manager. This is especially important if you are dealing with multiple tag implementations.\nIn the pixel tag you will notice the text “ch=1” . This represents the channel and in the case of the site pixel, the value is always “1”. You should also be sure that the token you are implementing is pasted correctly into the tag. Examples of both the\nChannel\nand\nToken\nare listed below:\n- Token example: VX1XL2BDTIGK\n- Channel example: ch=1\nYour tag should look like the following example:\n<SCRIPT type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"https://bh.contextweb.com/cp?p=7115&token=B1H8KNNPZ4VF&us_privacy=${us_privacy}&ch=1&url={{Page URL}}&rr={{Referrer}}&campaign={{Campaign_Name}}&frmtext={{Form Text}}&clktext={{Click Text}}&param1={{Optional_parameter}}&param2={{Optional_parameter}}&param3={{Optional_parameter}}&param4=\n{{Optional_parameter}}\n&param5={{Optional_parameter}}\" async></SCRIPT>\nAfter you have established that you are working with the correct pixel and chosen the site you want\nimplement your HCP365 pixel on, you can begin your setup by following the instructions below:\nStep 1\n:\nAccess the Google Tag Manager platform by visiting tagmanager.google.com. Choose the\naccount in which you intend to deploy the HCP365 pixel and click into that container.\nStep 2\n:\nIn the Workspace section, select “Tags” and click “New” or you can click “New Tag”on\nThe main page.\nStep 3\n: Name your Tag\nStep 4\n: Click “Tag Configuration”. A Dialog box will pop up on the right side of the screen with a list of tag types.\nStep 5\n:\nchoose tag type “Custom HTML”\nStep 5:\nClick into the “Tag Configuration” box and paste in the HCP365 Pixel provided to your by\nyour PulsePoint account team.\nYour pixel tag should look like the following when pasted correctly.:\nStep 6:\nMake sure to remove any optional parameters that you do not need. If there are no optional\nparameters as part of your tag, this means that your account manager has already removed it\nfor you.\n**THIS NEXT STEP IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT**\nStep 7\n:\nSome of the variables that we provide in our site pixel are consistent with GTM’s built in\nvariables, however, until we are able to make a permanent update, we recommend that you\ndelete the underscore in the placeholders and replace it with an empty space if you are\nlooking to use these variables in a dynamic manner. For example, this applies to the following\nvariables:\nCurrent Variables with placeholders containing underscores:\n&url={{Page\n_\nURL}}\n&frmtxt={{Form\n_\nText}}\n&clktxt={{click\n_\nText}}\nAdjusted Variables (No Underscores):\n&url={{Page URL}}\n&frmtxt={{Form Text}}\n&clktxt={{Click Text}}\nStep 7\n: Check the box that read “Support.document.write” and scroll down to the “Triggering”\nbefore saving your tag.\nStep 8:\nImplementing Your Trigger:\nBefore clicking “Save” after you have appended your pixel, you will notice a box at the\nbottom of the page that says “Triggering Box”. This is a shortcut to set up the trigger for\nyour pixel so that GTM knows what rule to apply to the tag. In the case of the site pixel, the\nrule is simple. You will want the pixel to fire on your homepage.\nThere are a few simple steps listed below in order to set this up properly:\n- Scroll down below the advanced settings option on the same page where you pasted in\nyour tag, and click on the “Triggering Box”\n-\nSelect the “\nAll Pages\n” option or the trigger type that conforms to your company policy. The\nrecommendation is\nPage View\nsince Initiation and Consent Initiation is designed to help\nensure all the consent settings are honored before other trigger fire “\nAll Pages\n”\n(Screenshot below)\nClick\n“\nSave”\nOnce you have saved both your tag and trigger, you can go ahead and click “Publish” to ensure that the changes are final.\n*\nClick here for instructions on how to set up a trigger from the main dashboard*\nHCP365 Pixel Variables & Parameters\nBuilt-in variables are available for many of the most commonly used tag and trigger configurations. Once enabled, they can be used just like user-defined variables. HCP365 pixel code supports both built-in GTM and custom (user-defined) variables as depicted in the box below.\nPixel Variable Name\nType\nGTM Variable equivalent\nRequired?\nurl\nUrl of the page the tag fired\nPage URL\nYes\nrr\nReferrer of the page\nReferrer\nYes\nus_privacy (\ndeprecated\n)\nCCPA Opt-Out\nCustom\nYes\nclktext\nClick related trigger\nClick Text\nOptional\nfrmtext\nForm related trigger\nForm Text\nOptional\nparam1-5\nP\nass\nHVA\ninformation to pixel\nCustom or user-defined\nOptional\ngpp string\nbut required in some cases. Consult you consent management platforms\nCustom or user-defined\nOptional but required in some cases\ngpp_sid string\nA unique identifier for each encoded privacy protocol string in a Global Privacy Platform (GPP) container.\nCustom or user-defined\nOptional but required in some cases\ncampaign\nName of the campaign you want to pass\nCustom\nOptional\nUtilizing Custom Variables in GTM\nIn addition to the built in variables mentioned above, the HCP365 site pixel also allows for up to 5 custom parameters to be passed via GTM as well. As long as these variables are configured correctly within the pixel, they can either be hardcoded or they can be set up dynamically by following the instructions below.\n*We do not recommend any additional custom parameters that track client ID’s as these types of parameters are in violation of PII*\nEx.\n“gclid”\nImplementing param1-param5 (Passing HVA information)\nParam1-Param5 refers to the variables within the HCP365 pixel code that allow organizations to establish custom variables and subsequently transmit them to the pixel. The variables are usually referred to as “HVA’s” or “High Value Actions”.\nExamples of this could be a button click or a pdf download.\nStep 1:\nIn the left navigation, click “Variables”\nStep 2:\nIn the User-Defined Variable section, click “New”\nStep 3:\nClick Variable Configuration and select the desired variable type.\nStep 4:\nEnter configuration options for the selected variable type.\nStep 5:\nName the variable and click “Save”\nStep 6:\nModify the HCP365 pixel code and replace the values for &param1-&param5\n<SCRIPT type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"https://bh.contextweb.com/cp?p=7115&token=B1H8KNNPZ4VF&us_privacy=${us_privacy}&ch=1&url={{Page URL}}&rr={{Referrer}}&campaign={{Campaign_Name}}&frmtext={{Form Text}}&clktext={{Click Text}}&param1=\n{{Optional_parameter}}\n&param2=\n{{Optional_parameter}}\n&param3=\n{{Optional_parameter}}\n&param4=\n{{Optional_parameter}}\n&param5=\n{{Optional_parameter}}\n\" async></SCRIPT>\nSetting Up Your Trigger From GTM’s Main Page\nStep 1:\nAccess your google Tag Manager by logging in to Google Tag Manager. Select the container\nfor the site that you want to create a trigger for.\nStep 2\n: Go to the \"Triggers\" Section: In the left-hand menu, click on “Triggers.” Then select “New”\nStep 3\n:\nName your trigger at the top of the pop-up box, then click “Trigger Configuration”\nThis will display a list of trigger types.\nStep 4\n: Choose your trigger type from the list. We recommend selecting “Page View”\nThe following is a description of what each of the following options mean for your what your HCP365 pixel will capture, feel free to click\nhere\nStep 5\n: After selecting “Page View” , you should have an option as to whether or not for your trigger to fire\nThe HCP365 pixel on all pages or some pages.\nHowever, if you want to adjust the trigger settings to fire on only some of your pages or just the homepage, then you can select “Some Page Views”\nSupplemental Resources\nPage View Triggers:\nhttps://support.google.com/tagmanager/answer/7679319?hl=en\nGTM Documentation:\nhttps://developers.google.com/tag-platform/tag-manager/templates",

For DTC campaigns, refer to the pixel labeled “DTC” or “Patient”. If you have questions regarding the pixel or pixel(s), please reach out to your account manager so they can assist you.\nFor SA360 - Make sure that “Auto-tagging” is enabled in GA or the Google Ads Platform so that \"GCLID\" automatically comes through for your Google Setup. For your Bing Setup, \"MSCLKID\" will come through if Microsoft Ads (Bing Ads) is connected to SA360.\nAny UTM parameters that you would like to have set up will need to be configured manually in the Final URL Suffix.\nImplementing Your HCP365 Search Pixel: SA360\nThere are\ntwo\noptions\nby which we recommend you place your HCP365 search pixel:\nOption 1\n:\nAccount-level Setup\n- Recommended only if your account contains only HCP, DTC or UNB\ncampaigns.\nOption 2\n:\nCampaign-level Setup\n-Recommended for if you have HCP, DTC, or UNB campaigns under the same\naccount.\n*\nThese options are applicable for both your\nSA360 - Google Pixel\nand your\nSA360 Bing Pixe\nl*\nBelow are examples of both tags that you will have the options of applying to SA360:\nHCP365 - Google Example:\nhttps://bh.contextweb.com/bh/sr?action=add&token=VX3XL5BDTIGK&ch=2&cid=PPC-accountype:{_dsaccounttype}-campaign:{_dscampaign}-searchterm:{_dssearchterm}-adgroup:{_dsadgroup}-keywordid:{_dskeywordid}&rurl={escapedlpurl}&us_privacy=${us_privacy}&gpp=${GPP_STRING_XXXXX}&gpp_sid=${GPP_SID]\nHCP365 - Bing Example:\nhttps://bh.contextweb.com/bh/sr?action=add&token=CTKQXQ18H6UB&ch=2&rurl={lpurl}&us_privacy=${us_privacy}&gpp=${GPP_STRING_XXXXX}&gpp_sid=${GPP_SID}\nGetting Started:\nOnce you have received your tag sheet from one of Pulsepoint's Account Managers, you should be ready to go! Be sure to let our team know if you have any questions regarding the tags that were sent. Some clients only Implement one or two tags while others implement many, so checking to ensure that you are placing the correct corresponding tag from the sheet to the designated account or campaign is highly recommended.\nTracking Template:\nThis is where you will be applying your Google or Bing tag.\nFinal URL Suffix\nYou can apply certain tagging strings here which will automatically be added to the end of your tracking template.\nAuto-Tagging:\nIn Sa360,there exists an auto-tagging feature that enables certain features for your tracking to be applied automatically.\nGoogle Pixel: Make sure auto-tagging is configured either through Google Analytics or Google Ads platforms. This will automatically provide the gclid and also UTM paramters as long as they are configured properly.\nBing Pixel: Auto tagging can be enabled if there is a configuration between SA360 and Microsoft Ads (Bing Ads) Platform. This will automatically provide the Msckid (Microsoft ID) or UTM Parameters.\nIf auto-tagging is not being used, you can apply the same parameters in the Final URL Suffix box.\nAccount-Level Setup\n:\nNow you are ready to set up your tag or tags!\nStep 1\n:\nlook to the panel on the left-hand side of the user interface.\n-Click on the “Settings” option followed by “Account Settings”\n- Scroll down and click on the “Tracking” dropdown tab.\nStep 2\n:\nCopy either your\nH\nCP365- Google Search\ntag\nor the\nHCP365\n- Bing\nsearch tag\nCombining Tracking Tag Templates:\nWhen setting up your Google\nOR\nBing tag on the account level, there will most likely be an existing template located in the\nTracking Template\nbox. If this is the case, Both will need to be combined with one another.\nBelow are examples of before and after tracking templates for both Google and Bing.\nEXAMPLE - (Tracking Template)\nBEFORE\n:\nhttps://ad.doubleclick.net/searchads/link/click?{_dssagcrid}&ds_a_cid=123456789&ds_a_caid={campaignid}&ds_a_agid={adgroupid}&ds_a_fiid={feeditemid}&ds_a_lid={targetid}&ds_a_extid={extensionid}&{_dssftfiid}&ds_e_adid={creative}&ds_e_matchtype={ifsearch:search}{ifcontent:content}&ds_e_device={device}&ds_e_network={network}&{ifpla:ds_e_product_group_id={product_partition_id}&ds_e_product_id={product_id}&ds_e_product_merchant_id={merchant_id}&ds_e_product_country={product_country}&ds_e_product_language={product_language}&ds_e_product_channel={product_channel}&ds_e_product_store_id={store_code}}&ds_url_v=2&ds_dest_url={unescapedlpurl}\nEXAMPLE - (Tracking Template + SA360 Pulsepoint Pixel)\nAFTER\n:\nhttps://ad.doubleclick.net/searchads/link/click?{_dssagcrid}&ds_a_cid=123456789&ds_a_caid={campaignid}&ds_a_agid={adgroupid}&ds_a_fiid={feeditemid}&ds_a_lid={targetid}&ds_a_extid={extensionid}&{_dssftfiid}&ds_e_adid={creative}&ds_e_matchtype={ifsearch:search}{ifcontent:content}&ds_e_device={device}&ds_e_network={network}&{ifpla:ds_e_product_group_id={product_partition_id}&ds_e_product_id={product_id}&ds_e_product_merchant_id={merchant_id}&ds_e_product_country={product_country}&ds_e_product_language={product_language}&ds_e_product_channel={product_channel}&ds_e_product_store_id={store_code}}&ds_url_v=2&\nds_dest_url\n=\nhttps%3A%2F%2Fbh.contextweb.com%2Fbh%2Fsr%3Faction%3Dadd%26token%3DPOPYRGQBTNZL%26ch%3D2%26cid%3DPPC-accountype%3A{_dsaccounttype}-campaign%3A{_dscampaign}-searchterm%3A{_dssearchterm}-adgroup%3A{_dsadgroup}-keywordid%3A{_dskeywordid}%26rurl%3D{escapedlpurl+2}%2526us_privacy%253D${us_privacy}\nThere is usually a \"\nds_dest_url={unescapedlpurl}\"\nparameter at the end of the SA360 template. The HCP365 tag should be pasted in place of the\n\"\nds_dest_url\"\nBelow is a before and after example of a Google tag template being added to your\nHCP365 Bing Tag.\nEXAMPLE - (Tracking Template)\nBEFORE\n:\nhttps://ad.doubleclick.net/searchads/link/click?{_dssagcrid}&{_dssadxid}&ds_e_adid={AdId}&ds_e_target_id={TargetId}&{ifpla:ds_e_product_group_id={CriterionId}&ds_e_product_id={ProductId}&ds_e_product_country={product_country}&ds_e_product_language={product_language}&ds_e_product_channel={product_channel}}&ds_e_network={network}&ds_url_v=2&ds_dest_url=\nEXAMPLE - (Tracking Template + SA360-Bing)\nAFTER\n:\nhttps://ad.doubleclick.net/searchads/link/click?{_dssagcrid}&{_dssadxid}&ds_e_adid={AdId}&ds_e_target_id={TargetId}&{ifpla:ds_e_product_group_id={CriterionId}&ds_e_product_id={ProductId}&ds_e_product_country={product_country}&ds_e_product_language={product_language}&ds_e_product_channel={product_channel}}&ds_e_network={network}&ds_url_v=2\n&ds_dest_url=\nhttps%3A%2F%2Fbh.contextweb.com%2Fbh%2Fsr%3Faction%3Dadd%26token%3D\nCTKQXQ18H6UB\n%26ch%3D2%26rurl%3D{lpurl+2}%26us_privacy%3D${us_privacy}\nStep 3:\nPaste either the original Tag provided into the Tracking Template or the combined version that you have created.\n*Applying UTM Parameters OR Recommended Strings*\nDirectly\nbelow the Tracking Template box, you will notice a content box labeled\n“\nFinal URL Suffix.\n”\nHCP 365 Google tag setup\n-you can apply if you are not using auto-tagging.\nHCP 365 Bing Tag setup\n- you can apply if not using auto-tagging, but you must apply the\nCID\nstring as well to each account or campaign level suffix.\nCombining both in a single string would be a rare occurrence, however, examples are both are listed below:\nBing UTM String:\nutm_source=bing&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign={_dscampaign}&utm_term={_dssearchterm}\nCDI String\n: cid=PPC-accountype:{_dsaccounttype}-campaign:{_dscampaign}-searchterm:{_dssearchterm}-adgroup:{_dsadgroup }-keywordid:{_dskeywordid}\nIf both are required, they can be combined and added together. The final string would look something like this:\ncid=PPC-accountype:{_dsaccounttype}-campaign:{_dscampaign}-searchterm:{_dssearchterm}-adgroup:{_dsadgroup }-keywordid:{_dskeywordid}\n&utm_source=bing&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign={_dscampaign}&utm_term={_dssearchterm}\nStep 4:\nOnce all of this is considered, compile your Final URL Suffix string and click on\nTEST\nStep 5\n:\nClick Save\nCampaign-level Setup:\nIf you have all HCP, DTC, and/or UNB campaigns falling under the same account, your HCP365 Search pixels will have to be implemented separately on the campaign level so that they can be tracked under the correct HCP365 collection.\nIf that is the case, please follow the setup below:\nStep 1:\nLook to the left-hand panel and click “Campaigns”\nStep 2:\nClick into your designated campaign and look once again to the left-hand panel and\nclick “Settings” then click “Campaign Settings” - This will reveal a menu with panels.\nStep 3:\nClick on “Additional Settings” - this will create another drop-down. Next, click\non the “Campaign URL Options” tab. This will reveal two boxes:\nTracking Template\nand\nFinal URL Suffix.\nGo ahead and apply your pixels to each campaign that you need to. Make sure Google pixels are being applied to Google Campaigns and Bing to Bing campaigns.\nStep 4:\nUnfortunately, auto-tagging does not apply for campaign level setup. This means the following:\nGoogle Tag:\napply your UTM's Manually\nBing Tag:\nApply your cid string. If your are using UTM's, you can apply those as well by combining both strings together.\nOnce tracking has been entered, Click “Test” to make sure that your tag is functioning properly, then click “SAVE.”\nSA360 - Bing Tracking Implementation\nThe same steps 1-5 li\nsted above can be applied when implementing your\nGoogle - Bing (SA360)\nPixel for tracking in SA360. Below is a brief description broken in a few steps. You can pretty much follow the instructions above if you are looking to implement on the Account level or the Campaign level.\nStep 1:\nClick on\nCopy/paste the\nG\noogle - Bing (SA360)\nscript provided by your Account Manager in\nto the “Tracking Template box\n.\nDo not include the Optional Parameters. It should look something like this:\nhttps://bh.contextweb.com/bh/sr?action=add&token=CTKQXQ18H6UB&ch=2&rurl={lpurl}&us_privacy=${us_privacy}&gpp=${GPP_STRING_XXXXX}&gpp_sid=${GPP_SID\n}\nStep 2:\nApply your UTM parameters into the Final URL Suffix box located directly below the Tracking Template. The additional parameters which are included in the pixel are optional.\n*IMPORTANT NOTE*\nIf you already have SA360 tracking set up and want to add your\nSA360-Bing\npixel into the same tracking template, this can be done by adding it onto the end of your existing tracking template and pasting it after the \"\nds_dest_url=\n\" parameter. It is also a good idea to encode our pixel\nto ensure that it remains intact, thereby preventing any potential tracking issues.\nBelow is an example of existing SA360 tracking\nbefore\nand\nafter\nadding your PulsePoint SA360-Bing Search Pixel. The Pulsepoint Pixel should be encoded to ensure that it remains intact, thereby preventing any potential tracking issues.\nEXAMPLE - (Tracking Template)\nBEFORE\n:\nhttps://ad.doubleclick.net/searchads/link/click?{_dssagcrid}&{_dssadxid}&ds_e_adid={AdId}&ds_e_target_id={TargetId}&{ifpla:ds_e_product_group_id={CriterionId}&ds_e_product_id={ProductId}&ds_e_product_country={product_country}&ds_e_product_language={product_language}&ds_e_product_channel={product_channel}}&ds_e_network={network}&ds_url_v=2&ds_dest_url=\nEXAMPLE - (Tracking Template + SA360-Bing)\nAFTER\n:\nhttps://ad.doubleclick.net/searchads/link/click?{_dssagcrid}&{_dssadxid}&ds_e_adid={AdId}&ds_e_target_id={TargetId}&{ifpla:ds_e_product_group_id={CriterionId}&ds_e_product_id={ProductId}&ds_e_product_country={product_country}&ds_e_product_language={product_language}&ds_e_product_channel={product_channel}}&ds_e_network={network}&ds_url_v=2\n&ds_dest_url=\nhttps%3A%2F%2Fbh.contextweb.com%2Fbh%2Fsr%3Faction%3Dadd%26token%3D\nCTKQXQ18H6UB\n%26ch%3D2%26rurl%3D{lpurl+2}%26us_privacy%3D${us_privacy}\nFor the Final URL Suffix, we recommend that you implement the following:\nAvailable Macros:\nImplementing Your HCP365 Bing Pixel in Microsoft Ads Platform\nIn a scenario where you have a standalone setup in Microsoft Ads and you are not utilizing SA360, our team can provide you with a Bing pixel specifically designed to operate within that platform.\nJust like with SA360, your pixel can be implemented on the\nAccount Level\nor the\nCampaign Level.\nTo implement your Bing pixel, please adhere to the following Instructions:\nAccount-level Setup:\nStep 1:\nGo to the Microsoft Advertising website and log in to your account.\nStep 2\n:\nFrom the navigation menu on the left, Click on the\nCampaigns\nicon and select Settings > Account level options.\nStep 3:\nAt the bottom of the list, select Settings > Account level options.\nStep 4:\nPaste your Bing pixel script provided to you by your account manager into the “\nTracking\nTemplate”\nbox. It should look something like this:\nhttps://bh.contextweb.com/bh/sr?action=add&token=VX1XL2BDTIGK&ch=2&cid=PPC-accountype:MICROSOFT-campaign:{campaign}-searchterm:{keyword:default}-adgroup:{adgroup}-keywordid:{targetid}&rurl={escapedlpurl}&gclid={msclkid}&us_privacy=${us_privacy}&gpp=${GPP_STRING_XXXXX}&gpp_sid\n=${GPP_SID}\nStep 5\n:\n*\nAdding In UTM Parameters*\n* If you have enabled Auto-tagging for the UTM and Click ID, your Bing account will automatically apply the necessary parameters\nneeded for when your ad is clicked and your desired data is captured. These options are in the screenshot below.\nIf these boxes are not checked, you must apply your UTM parameters in the Final URL Suffix located right below the Tracking Template.\nThe UTM parameters\nshould not\nbe added into the Bing Pixel and pasted into the Tracking template. *\nStep 6\n:\nClick “Save”\nCampaign-level Setup:\nStep 1\n:\nClick on the\nCampaigns\ntab in the left-hand menu.\nStep 2\n: Click on the campaign that you want to apply your pixel tracking to.\nStep 3\n:\nClick on the “Settings” tab and select “Campaign settings”\nStep 4:\nIn your campaign settings, scroll down to the\nTracking\nsection of the page.\nStep 5\n:\nPaste your Bing pixel script provided to you by your account manager into the “\nTracking\nTemplate”\nbox.\n(Example shown above in directions for Account-level implementation)\nStep 6\n:\nIf you have enabled Auto-tagging, your Bing account will automatically apply the necessary UTM\nParams needed for the Final URL Suffix box. If not, you can apply your UTMs or additional\nparameters manually.\nImportant note to consider:\nIf you create a tracking template at the campaign, ad group, ad or sitelink extension level, it will override the account tracking template. When your ad is served, the lowest level tracking template will be appended to your landing page URL.\nImplementing your HCP365 Pixel in Google Ads:\nOur search pixel can also be implemented in google ads as well. Directions to follow are listed below.\nAccount-Level Setup:\nStep 1\n:\nLog into your Google Ads Account\nStep 2\n: Click “Settings” in the left-hand panel of the UI\nStep 3:\nSelect ‘Account Settings’ and then ‘Tracking’. Enter your tracking template information, and click ‘Save’ to confirm.\nStep 4:\nPaste your pixel into the Tracking Template. tracking template information, and click ‘Save’ to confirm.\nhttps://bh.contextweb.com/bh/sr?action=add&token=VX3XL5BDTIGK&ch=2&cid=PPC-accountype:GOOGLE-campaign:{campaignid}-searchterm:{keyword}-adgroup:{adgroupid}-keywordid:{targetid}&rurl={escapedlpurl}&&gclid={gclid}&us_privacy=${us_privacy}&gpp=${GPP_STRING_XXXXX}&gpp_sid=${GPP_SID}\nAny additional Parameters including UTM parameters can be added into the Final URL Suffix.\nStep 5\n:\nClick “Test” to make sure your tag is working properly. If so, go ahead and click “Save”\nCampaign Level S\netup:\nStep 1\n: Log in to your google ads account\nStep 2\n:\nSelect the account that you would like to track.\nStep 3\n:\nClick “Settings” followed by “Additional Settings”\nStep 4:\nSelect “Campaign URL Options”\nStep 5\n:\nEnter your tracking template information into the Tracking Template box. An example of the code can be seen in the directions above for Account-level implementation.

This includes the parameter of each pixel and the description of that parameter.\n*One thing to note here is that the “Search Term” parameter captures the searches that users enter in Google or Bing which also match up the keywords on your keyword lists.\nAny searches entered by users that do not match up with your keyword list but do lead to a user clicking on your search ad need to be accrued in HCP reporting by the use of an optional parameter*\nHCP365 SA360 -

This file contains the email tracking information, including click-through links and call-to-action (CTA) buttons.\nStep 2:\nCheck for Existing Tags\nDetermine if the client has existing click trackers (e.g., DoubleClick). If so, you will need to wrap your tag around theirs to ensure data is captured by both systems. The file should look something like the\nfollowing\n:\nWrapping Your Email Click Trackers\nStep 1\n: Identifying Your Click Trackers\nReview the file to locate existing click trackers that require wrapping. Make sure to select the\n“Click Trackers”\ntab - You can avoid the Impression Trackers tab and/or the Tracking Ads tab if they are both provided.\nStep 2\n: Encode the URL\nThe client should be providing a URL within the click tracker tab\nCopy the click tracker tag up until semicolon before the “GDPR” parameter\nEx:\nhttps://ad.doubleclick.net/ddm/clk/594131489;402193103;a\nUse a URL Encoder tool (URLEncoder.com) to encode special characters.\nPaste the URL into the encoder and click “Encode”. Delete the “%0A” encoding at the end of the URL.\nSee Example Here:\nReplace symbols (e.g., / with %2F, : with %3A) as needed.\nPaste the encoded URL into the email tag template after “&rurl=”\nExample provided below:\nStep 3\n: Formatting the Click Tag\nThe click tag should include the following:\nToken ID: Unique identifier for the tag within HCP365.\nCH=6: Indicates an email click. (ALWAYS Q/A THIS)\nSubscriber Key: Include if available.\nNPI Number: Mandatory for recipient identification.\nCampaign Name: For tracking purposes. (Listed on Tracker)\nUTM Parameters: Capture UTM parameters from the client’s click tracker.\nExample:\nA utm string should appear as the following with the utm values inserted:\nutm_source\n=wkh&\nutm_medium\n=email&\nutm_content\n=us-fa-2400353_fin_hcp_wkh_neu-ebl-one-hea-sou_spe_neu_flat_sis_0-v_crs_ema_1x1&\nutm_term\n=us-fa-2400353_ema_htm_cst_bra_hcp_sop-wkh-ebl_tbd&\nutm_campaign\n=2024-q2-q4_ucb_fin_hcp\nOnce you have encoded your UTM’s, it should look like the following:\nEncoded UTM String:\n%26utm_source%3Dwkh%26utm_medium%3Demail%26utm_content%3Dus-fa-2400353_fin_hcp_wkh_neu-ebl-one-hea-sou_spe_neu_flat_sis_0-v_crs_ema_1x1%26utm_term%3Dus-fa-2400353_ema_htm_cst_bra_hcp_sop-wkh-ebl_tbd%26utm_campaign%3D2024-q2-q4_ucb_fin_hcp\nOur pixels parameters can be filled out based on the info provided in the click tracker tab for each tag.\nExample:\ncampaign\n: Name of Campaign listed on Tracker Tab\nadgroup\n: Click Tracker Name listed on Tracker Tab\nThe final tag after encoding should look like the following:\nhttps://bh.contextweb.com/bh/sr?action=add&token=SOWFZZWDOQEB&ch=6&pp_fpid=[SubscriberKey]&pp_nid={{NPI}}&campaign=us-fa-2400353_fin_hcp_wkh_neu-ebl-one-hea-sou_spe_neu_flat_sis_0-v_crs_ema_1x1&adgroup=us-fa-2400353_fin_hcp_wkh_neu-ebl-one-hea-sou_spe_neu_flat_sis_0-v_crs_ema_1x1_hea-sou&us_privacy=${us_privacy}&rurl=https%3A%2F%2Fad.doubleclick.net%2Fddm%2Fclk%2F594157221%3B401964820%3Bf&%26utm_source%3Dwkh%26utm_medium%3Demail%26utm_content%3Dus-fa-2400353_fin_hcp_wkh_neu-ebl-one-hea-sou_spe_neu_flat_sis_0-v_crs_ema_1x1%26utm_term%3Dus-fa-2400353_ema_htm_cst_bra_hcp_sop-wkh-ebl_tbd%26utm_campaign%3D2024-q2-q4_ucb_fin_hcp\nCreating and Embedding Open Trackers\nThe reason why we create Open Trackers is so that we can track if an email is opened. This helps for our clients to further optimize their campaign strategy.\nStep 1\n: Embed your tag\nEmbed a simple image tag into the HTML header of the email. No URL encoding is necessary.\nStep 2\n: Format your tag using the following\nCH=4: Indicates an email open.\nToken ID: Remains the same for tracking.\nCampaign Name: Include for tracking.\nA finalized tag should look like the following:\n<img src=\"https://bh.contextweb.com/bh/sr?action=add&token=SOWFZZWDOQEB&ch=4&pp_nid={{NPI}}&campaign=2024-q2-q4_ucb_fin_hcp&adgroup=[SEGMENT_NAME]&us_privacy=${us_privacy}\"/>\nTesting Your Tags\nTest Each Tag\nAfter wrapping the tags, verify that each click tag redirects correctly.\nPaste the wrapped URL into a browser’s address bar.\nEnsure proper redirection to the final destination without errors (e.g., no 404).\nThe destination url should match the url provided for each tag.\nFinalizing Your Email Tags\nReview the Final Document\nEnsure all click and open trackers are properly encoded and formatted.\nReturn to Client or Partner\nShare the finalized file with the client or their email deployment partner (e.g., IQVIA) for inclusion in the email campaign.\nPost-Deployment Monitoring\nMonitor Campaign Data\nAfter the email campaign goes live, track the data received through HCP365 to confirm clicks and opens are being recorded as expected.\nTrack Metrics\nBoth you and the client will receive data on email opens and clicks to assess campaign effectiveness.\nKey Considerations\nAlways use the most recent template provided by the client.\nEnsure each email’s UTM parameters and click tracker are correctly configured.\nIf there are existing trackers from other systems, wrap them within your tags to capture all necessary data.\nCreating Email Click & Open Tags Without DCM Trackers\nYou may end up receiving a file that is not associated with DCM tracking because the client wants to hardcode their pixels.\nIf this is the case, we should be receiving an excel doc or a shared google doc with the email pixels that we already provided them broken out into different columns.\nThis process is very similar to that of the process for setting up tags to be formatted and embedded for DCM except that we may be using different information in order to format our tags. The client will also provide CTA links. For every CTA link, you will need to create a click tag.\nPreparing Your File\nIf the client provides you with a google doc or excel file, it should contain columns for both open and click email tags unless specified otherwise.\nBelow is an example of a doc that a client may provide and can also be seen\nhere\n:\nStep 1\n:\nInspect the Open Pixel Tracker and make sure the token listed is correct and\nthat your channel is set to 4 (ch=4)\nStep 2\n:\nFill in both “campaign=” and “adgroup=” parameters using the name of the tracker that\nthe client provided.\nCampaign gets the full name and ad group gets the second half of the name as this is how our clients sometimes categorize their data. Check with your account manager if you are not sure.\nExample:\n&campaign=XIF.0109.USA.24-XFN_OHE_ Welcome/Thankyou_Marketo_Email\n&adgroup=XFN_OHE_ Welcome/Thankyou_Marketo_Email\nThe final pixel tracker should look like the following:\nFormatting Your Click Trackers:\nStep 1:\nCreate an extra column in your doc for the click tags. You can start by either pasting in the same tag that we provided to the client or you can adjust one of the open trackers that were created and/or were provided.\nWhen formatting your tag, make sure you have the following:\n- Token ID\n- Subscriber ID\n- NPI Number\n- Channel ID “ch=6”\n- Referrer URL “rurl”\nStep 2\n:\nYou will need to encode the url that was provided for the “CTA Link”. You\ncan do with by using the encode/decode tool:\nhttps://www.urldecoder.org/\nOnce you have encoded the url, create a new column and label it\n“\nEncoded CTA Link 1\n.”\nGo ahead and paste the link into the click tag “rurl” parameter. The\nfinal encoded url should be followed by the UTM’s as well.\nExample:\n&rurl=https%3A%2F%2F\nwww.xifaxan.com%2Fhcp%2Fohe%2Fdiagnosis%2F%3Futm_source%3Demail%26utm_medium%3Dmkto%26utm_campaign%3Dsignupthankyou\nStep 3\n:\nPaste the full tracker name in the ”SEGMENT” placeholder “\ncampaign\n”\nparameter.\nex\n. &campaign=XIF.0109.USA.24-XFN_OHE_\nWelcome/Thankyou_Marketo_Email\nStep 4\n: Paste the “CTA” value from the doc into the “adgroup=” parameter value.\nThis will be provided in the doc and can be seen in the “CTA1” column\nabove.\nBe sure to add underscores “_” in between the words when pasting into\nthe tag. There cannot be any spaces.\nExample\n: &adgroup=Get_Diagnosing_Tips\n* The “adgroup” parameter in your tag does not necessarily have to be the\nCTA Value. It can also be an email header or a “job name” *\nStep 5\n: Check your tag once again to make sure everything has been included.\nYour Final tag should look like the following:\nThe final text will look something like this:\nhttps://bh.contextweb.com/bh/sr?action=add&token=VX3XL5BDTIGK&ch=6&pp_fpid=[SubscriberKey]&pp_hid=[HashedEmailAddress]&pp_nid={{Account.NPI_vod__c}}&campaign=XIF.0109.USA.24-XFN_OHE_ Welcome/Thankyou_Marketo_Email&adgroup=Get_Diagnosing_Tips&us_privacy=${us_privacy}&gpp=${GPP_STRING_XXXXX}&gpp_sid=${GPP_SID}&rurl=https%3A%2F%2F\nwww.xifaxan.com%2Fhcp%2Fohe%2Fdiagnosis%2F%3Futm_source%3Demail%26utm_medium%3Dmkto%26utm_campaign%3Dsignupthankyou\nTesting Your Click Tags:\nOnce all of your tags are configured, Paste the wrapped URL into a browser’s address bar. The tag should click thru successfully and land on the destination page (CTA link url) provided by the client.\nFinalizing Your Email Tags:\nReview your tags and send them back to the partner\n.",

The example depicted below is a Campaign-level implementation.\nStep 1\n:\nNavigate to\nCampaign Properties\nand click on “\nCampaign Tag\ns” under the Impression\nEvent Tags.\nStep 2:\nName your tag and select “\nImage\n” for your\nTag type\n. Also make sure your tag is enabled\nand that\nApplication\nis set to “\nApply Automatically\n”. This ensures that the pixel is applied\nto all tags within your Campaign or Advertiser\nStep 3:\nPaste your HCP365 Media Click Pixel into the\nTag URL\nbox. Include any Optional\nParameters as well that you wish to pull into your HCP365 reporting.\nStep 4:\nOnce you paste in the script, CM360 should automatically detect the\nkey-value pairs. Adjustments can be made if necessary to the delimiter\nkeys to match each parameter in the tag (See Example below)\n*If you intend to add any Optional Parameters, be sure to add them to the\nend of the pixel as well as they are not depicted in the example below*\nStep 5\n:\nClick “Save” when you are done.\nEVENT TAG SETUP - HCP365 CM Media Clicks Pixel\nWhen setting up your HCP365 pixel for clicks, the same steps can be followed above, however you do not need to choose a Tag type.\nStep 1\n:\nNavigate to Campaign Properties and click on “\nCampaign Tags\n” under\nthe “Click Event Tags”\nStep 2:\nName your tag. Also make sure your tag is enabled.\nStep 3:\nPaste your HCP365 Media Click Pixel into the Tag URL box. Include any\nOptional Parameters as well that you wish to pull into your HCP365\nreporting. All values should automatically be detected and can be\nCustomized.\nYou’ll also want to select an option for the “Escaping” box as this option is reserved for click tags and applicable due to the special characters within our pixel.\nStep 4\n:\nClick “Save”\nAdditional Resources:\nGoogle’s CM360 Event Tag Documentation located\nhere\nPULSEPOINT.COM",

For DTC campaigns, refer to the pixel labeled “DTC” or “Patient”. If you have questions regarding the pixel or pixel(s), please reach out to your account manager so they can assist you.\nMake sure that “\nAuto-tagging\n” is enabled for your platform if you are planning on utilizing UTM parameters. We highly recommend this option if you are not using UTM parameters because it ensures that other parameters make their way to the final URL as well. For more information, you can refer to the links provided on page 14.\nInstructions For Implementing Your HCP365 Search Pixel:\nThere are\ntwo\noptions\nby which we recommend you place your HCP365 search pixel:\nOption 1\n:\nAccount-level Setup\n- Recommended only if your account contains only HCP, DTC or UNB\ncampaigns.\nOption 2\n:\nCampaign-level Setup\n-Recommended for if you have HCP, DTC, or UNB campaigns under the same\naccount.\n*\nThese Methods are applicable for both your\nSA360 - Google Pixel\nand your\nSA360 Bing Pixe\nl*\nAccount-Level Setup\n:\nStep 1\n:\nlook to the panel on the left-hand side of the user interface.\n-Click on the “Settings” option followed by “Account Settings”\n- Scroll down and click on the “Tracking” dropdown tab.\nStep 2\n:\nCopy/paste the following portion of the\nHCP365 search pixel script provided by your account\nmanager into the\nfirst\nbox labeled “Tracking template”\nhttps://bh.contextweb.com/bh/sr?action=add&token=VX3XL5BDTIGK&ch=2&cid=PPC-accountype:{_dsaccounttype}-campaign:{_dscampaign}-searchterm:{_dssearchterm}-adgroup:{_dsadgroup}-keywordid:{_dskeywordid}&rurl={escapedlpurl}&&gclid={gclid}&us_privacy=${us_privacy}&gpp=${GPP_STRING_XXXXX}&gpp_sid=${GPP_SID]\nStep 3:\nThe box labeled '\nFinal URL Suffix\n' can be avoided if you have auto-tagging enabled, however, if you are combining our tag with an existing search template then we advise you include add\ngclid={gclid}\ninto the Final URL Suffix. This will ensure that the \"GCLID\" makes its way into the final URL and may prevent google from invalidating clicks that should not be invalidated. if you do not need\n&gclsrc=aw.ds\nor\n&{_dsmrktparam}\nIf you have questions about this, please reach out to your Account Manager.\nStep 4\n:\nIt’s always a good idea to click the “\nTest\n” button as well to make sure that the code you\nhave inserted is operational.\nStep 5\n:\nOnce your Pixel is placed, click “\nSave\n”\n*IMPORTANT NOTE*\n(Combining Pulsepoint Search Pixel with Existing Search Tracking)\nIf you already have SA360 tracking set up and want to add your SA360 Google PulsePoint pixel into the same tracking template, this can be done by adding it onto the end of your existing tracking template and pasting it after the \"\nds_dest_url=\n\" parameter. It is also a good idea to encode our pixel\nto ensure that it remains intact, thereby preventing any potential tracking issues.\nBelow is an example of existing SA360 tracking\nbefore\nand\nafter\nadding your PulsePoint Google Search Pixel. The Pulsepoint Pixel should be encoded to ensure that it remains intact, thereby preventing any potential tracking issues.\nEXAMPLE - (Tracking Template)\nBEFORE\n:\nhttps://ad.doubleclick.net/searchads/link/click?{_dssagcrid}&ds_a_cid=123456789&ds_a_caid={campaignid}&ds_a_agid={adgroupid}&ds_a_fiid={feeditemid}&ds_a_lid={targetid}&ds_a_extid={extensionid}&{_dssftfiid}&ds_e_adid={creative}&ds_e_matchtype={ifsearch:search}{ifcontent:content}&ds_e_device={device}&ds_e_network={network}&{ifpla:ds_e_product_group_id={product_partition_id}&ds_e_product_id={product_id}&ds_e_product_merchant_id={merchant_id}&ds_e_product_country={product_country}&ds_e_product_language={product_language}&ds_e_product_channel={product_channel}&ds_e_product_store_id={store_code}}&ds_url_v=2&ds_dest_url={unescapedlpurl}\nEXAMPLE - (Tracking Template + SA360 Pulsepoint Pixel)\nAFTER\n:\nhttps://ad.doubleclick.net/searchads/link/click?{_dssagcrid}&ds_a_cid=123456789&ds_a_caid={campaignid}&ds_a_agid={adgroupid}&ds_a_fiid={feeditemid}&ds_a_lid={targetid}&ds_a_extid={extensionid}&{_dssftfiid}&ds_e_adid={creative}&ds_e_matchtype={ifsearch:search}{ifcontent:content}&ds_e_device={device}&ds_e_network={network}&{ifpla:ds_e_product_group_id={product_partition_id}&ds_e_product_id={product_id}&ds_e_product_merchant_id={merchant_id}&ds_e_product_country={product_country}&ds_e_product_language={product_language}&ds_e_product_channel={product_channel}&ds_e_product_store_id={store_code}}&ds_url_v=2&\nds_dest_url\n=\nhttps%3A%2F%2Fbh.contextweb.com%2Fbh%2Fsr%3Faction%3Dadd%26token%3DPOPYRGQBTNZL%26ch%3D2%26cid%3DPPC-accountype%3A{_dsaccounttype}-campaign%3A{_dscampaign}-searchterm%3A{_dssearchterm}-adgroup%3A{_dsadgroup}-keywordid%3A{_dskeywordid}%26rurl%3D{escapedlpurl+\n2\n}%2526us_privacy%253D${us_privacy)\nOnce you have implemented your final template, navigate to the\nFinal URL Suffix\nBox and add the following:\ngclid={gclid}\nThis should be the only parameter added to the box in cases where we are combining tracking. Additional parameters like\ngclsrc=aw.ds\nor\n{_dsmrktparam}\ncan cause the GCLID parameter to be stripped\n.\nAuto-tagging will add the gclrsrc=aw.ds to the final url. is enabled so any UTM Parameters being passed can be passed automatically by SA360.\nCampaign-level Setup:\nIf you have all HCP, DTC, and/or UNB campaigns falling under the same account, your HCP365 Search pixels will have to be implemented separately on the campaign level so that they can be tracked under the correct HCP365 collection.\nIf that is the case, please follow the setup below:\nStep 1:\nLook to the left-hand panel and click “Campaigns”\nStep 2:\nClick into your designated campaign and look once again to the left-hand panel and\nclick “Settings” then click “Campaign Settings” - This will reveal a menu with panels.\nStep 3:\nClick on “Additional Settings” - this will create another drop-down. Next, click\non the “Campaign URL Options” tab. This will reveal two boxes:\nTracking Template\nand\nFinal URL Suffix.\nJust like the copy & paste instructions for\nStep 2\nunder “\nAccount-Level Setup”\n, the pixel can be implemented the same way. The only difference is that you will have to implement different pixels to match the campaign’s audience segment.\n- After pasting the pixel into the Tracking Template box or both boxes if you have additional parameters to add, be sure to Click “Test”to make sure that your tag is functioning properly, then click “SAVE.”\nSA360 - Google / Bing Tracking Implementation\nThe same steps 1-5 li\nsted above can be applied when implementing your\nGoogle - Bing (SA360)\nPixel for tracking in SA360. Below is a brief description broken in a few steps. You can pretty much follow the instructions above if you are looking to implement on the Account level or the Campaign level.\nStep 1:\nClick on\nCopy/paste the\nG\noogle - Bing (SA360)\nscript provided by your Account Manager in\nto the “Tracking Template box\n.\nDo not include the Optional Parameters. It should look something like this:\nhttps://bh.contextweb.com/bh/sr?action=add&token=XRH1D9FSUMNN&ch=2&cid=PPC-accountype:{_dsaccounttype}-campaign:{_dscampaign}-searchterm:{_dssearchterm}-adgroup:{_dsadgroup}-keywordid:{_dskeywordid}&rurl={escapedlpurl}&&gclid={gclid}&us_privacy=${us_privacy}&gpp=${GPP_STRING_XXXXX}&gpp_sid=${GPP_SID}\nStep 2:\nApply your UTM parameters into the Final URL Suffix box located directly below the Tracking Template. The additional parameters which are included in the pixel are optional.\nThe Following list of Macros below are compatible with the HCP365 / SA360-Bing Integration:\nAvailable Macros:\nImplementing Your HCP365 Bing Pixel in Microsoft Ads Platform\nIn a scenario where you have a standalone setup in Microsoft Ads and you are not utilizing SA360, our team can provide you with a Bing pixel specifically designed to operate within that platform.\nJust like with SA360, your pixel can be implemented on the\nAccount Level\nor the\nCampaign Level.\nTo implement your Bing pixel, please adhere to the following Instructions:\nAccount-level Setup:\nStep 1:\nGo to the Microsoft Advertising website and log in to your account.\nStep 2\n:\nFrom the navigation menu on the left, Click on the\nCampaigns\nicon and select Settings > Account level options.\nStep 3:\nAt the bottom of the list, select Settings > Account level options.\nStep 4:\nPaste your Bing pixel script provided to you by your account manager into the “\nTracking\nTemplate”\nbox. It should look something like this:\nhttps://bh.contextweb.com/bh/sr?action=add&token=VX1XL2BDTIGK&ch=2&cid=PPC-accountype:MICROSOFT-campaign:{campaign}-searchterm:{keyword:default}-adgroup:{adgroup}-keywordid:{targetid}&rurl={escapedlpurl}&&gclid={msclkid}&us_privacy=${us_privacy}&gpp=${GPP_STRING_XXXXX}&gpp_sid\n=${GPP_SID}\nStep 4\n:\nIf you have enabled Auto-tagging, your Bing account will automatically apply the necessary UTM\nParams needed for the Final URL Suffix box. If not, you can apply your UTMs or additional\nparameters manually.\nStep 5\n:\nClick “Save”\nCampaign-level Setup:\nStep 1\n:\nClick on the\nCampaigns\ntab in the left-hand menu.\nStep 2\n: Click on the campaign that you want to apply your pixel tracking to.\nStep 3\n:\nClick on the “Settings” tab and select “Campaign settings”\nStep 4:\nIn your campaign settings, scroll down to the\nTracking\nsection of the page.\nStep 5\n:\nPaste your Bing pixel script provided to you by your account manager into the “\nTracking\nTemplate”\nbox.\n(Example shown above in directions for Account-level implementation)\nStep 6\n:\nIf you have enabled Auto-tagging, your Bing account will automatically apply the necessary UTM\nParams needed for the Final URL Suffix box. If not, you can apply your UTMs or additional\nparameters manually.\nImportant note to consider:\nIf you create a tracking template at the campaign, ad group, ad or sitelink extension level, it will override the account tracking template. When your ad is served, the lowest level tracking template will be appended to your landing page URL.\nImplementing your HCP365 Pixel in Google Ads:\nOur search pixel can also be implemented in google ads as well. Directions to follow are listed below.\nAccount-Level Setup:\nStep 1\n:\nLog into your Google Ads Account\nStep 2\n: Click “Settings” in the left-hand panel of the UI\nStep 3:\nSelect ‘Account Settings’ and then ‘Tracking’. Enter your tracking template information, and click ‘Save’ to confirm.\nStep 4:\nPaste your pixel into the Tracking Template. tracking template information, and click ‘Save’ to confirm.\nhttps://bh.contextweb.com/bh/sr?action=add&token=VX3XL5BDTIGK&ch=2&cid=PPC-accountype:GOOGLE-campaign:{campaignid}-searchterm:{keyword}-adgroup:{adgroupid}-keywordid:{targetid}&rurl={escapedlpurl}&&gclid={gclid}&us_privacy=${us_privacy}&gpp=${GPP_STRING_XXXXX}&gpp_sid=${GPP_SID}\nAny additional Parameters including UTM parameters can be added into the Final URL Suffix.\nStep 5\n:\nClick “Test” to make sure your tag is working properly. If so, go ahead and click “Save”\nCampaign Level S\netup:\nStep 1\n: Log in to your google ads account\nStep 2\n:\nSelect the account that you would like to track.\nStep 3\n:\nClick “Settings” followed by “Additional Settings”\nStep 4:\nSelect “Campaign URL Options”\nStep 5\n:\nEnter your tracking template information into the Tracking Template box. An example of the code can be seen in the directions above for Account-level implementation. Enter any custom or UTM parameters in the Final URL Suffix box.\n*If Auto-tagging is enabled, you can ignore entering UTM parameters manually*\nStep 6\n: “Test” to make sure your setup is correct and then click “Save”\nAdditional Steps To Help Pulsepoint Q/A:\nSome additional steps to help the PulsePoint team Q/A your pixel after setup would be to provide the top keywords for your ads so the team can test to make sure the pixel is recording.\nKeyword Testing:\nA Quick way for you to test to see if your ad is appearing on google would be to type in a keyword from the keyword list indicated by the red arrow below.\n*You must ensure that the keyword list is populating under the same campaign name as our pixel.*\nHCP365 Pixel Parameters and Descriptions:\nBelow is a breakout for each pixel and its components. This includes the parameter of each pixel and the description of that parameter.\n*One thing to note here is that the “Search Term” parameter captures the searches that users enter in Google or Bing which also match up the keywords on your keyword lists.\nAny searches entered by users that do not match up with your keyword list but do lead to a user clicking on your search ad need to be accrued in HCP reporting by the use of an optional parameter*\nHCP365 SA360 -

(F)\nCAUTION - There is no confirmation prompt, and this action cannot be undone.\nWe do not support uploading a file to update a sublist.\nConvert Sublist to Standalone List\nThis command converts a sublist to a separate list and removes it from the parent list. Any targeting of the converted list is preserved.\nClick\n.\nYou can manage this list as you would any other top-level list. Click\nhere\nfor info.\nTargeting Sublists\nYou can target sublists just as you would for any other NPI list.\nSublists display below parent list.

      "content": "What Are Archived Lists?\nArchived lists\nfacilitate organizing lists such as\nNPI Lists\nand\nKeyword Lists\n. They allow you to hide lists you are not currently using so they do not appear when targeting. You archive the lists in the\nLists\nsection of the\nPulsePoint Menu\n, and can unarchive as needed.\nArchiving/Unarchiving Lists\nWe support these functions for the following lists:\nNPI Lists such as:\nStatic NPI Lists\nStatic NPI Lists with Attributes\nNPI Smart Lists\nTM\nKeyword Lists\nDomain/App Lists\nIP Lists\nHow do I Tell if a List is Archived?\nIf you are viewing an archived list, the\nArchived\nindicator will be highlighted at the left of the screen.\nArchiving List\nIn this section, we use\nKeyword Lists\nas an example. Other list types function similarly.\nNOTES\nYou cannot modify an archived list.\nArchived\nNPI Smart Lists\nwill not auto-update.\n--\nIMPORTANT\nYou cannot archive lists associated with a live tactic (status = (e.g.)\nPending Appr\n,\nReady\n, or\nRunning\n).\nIf you archived a list associated with a not-live tactic, and the tactic becomes live (see example below), you must\nunarchive\nthe list if you wish to target it.\nExample:\nToday is\n5/2/25\n.\nThe tactic is\nFinished\nbecause the parent line item ended on\n4/30/25\n.\nYou add a flight for\n5/1/25\nto\n5/31/25\n.\nNow,\nunarchive\nthe list,\nTo view a list's associated tactics (live or otherwise) click\n.per below screenshot. (A\n↓\n)\nBring up list in\nLists\n.\n(OPTIONAL): Click\nto\nview/remove associated tactics\n. (A)\nClick\nto archive. (B)\nIf the list is associated with a live tactic, a warning window displays. To remove associations, click\nView Associated Tactics\nand follow prompts. When done, return to step\n3\n.\nViewing Archived List (Including Unarchving List)\nNOTES\nYou cannot modify an archived list.\nArchived\nNPI Smart Lists\nwill not auto-update.\n--\nIMPORTANT\nIf you archived a list associated with a not-live tactic, you will need to unarchive it if tactic becomes live.\ne.g., You add a flight to the parent line item of a\nFinished\ntactic.\nTo view a list's associated tactics (live or otherwise) click\n.\nIn\nLists\n, filter on archived lists.\nBring up list.\n(OPTIONAL): Click\nto\nview/remove associated tactics\n. (A)\nClick\nto unarchive list. (B)\n>\nNOTE\n- Click\nto\npermanently\ndelete list. (C)\n>>\nCAUTION: This deletion cannot be undone.\nAny currently associated tactics will now resume targeting this list, and you can target this list going forward.\nNOTE\nFor archived lists consisting of CSV files such as:\nKeyword Lists\nDomain/App Lists\nYou can download an individual (CSV or TXT) file to another file per the screenshot below.\nView/Remove Associated Tactics\nWhen you are viewing a list such as a\nKeyword List\nor a\nDomain/App List\n, you can bring up a window containing associated tactics and their parent line items. An\nassociated tactic\nis one that targets a particular list. (Archived lists are still associated with their tactics,\nbut not actively targeted\n.)\nHINT\nYou can use this process to facilitate archiving lists. Since you cannot archive a list associated with live tactics, you must first remove the associations between the list and the tactics per the instructions below.\nThe example below is for Keyword Lists; other lists function in a similar fashion.\nClick\n.

      "content": "User Guide\nRequired EHR Channel Criteria\n:\nFollowing these guidelines will provide the most effective EHR targeting and reporting.\nUser specific criteria\nSelf-service, self-service+ and managed service users can access EHR channel supply.\nCampaign specific criteria:\nHCP Only:\nEHR channel supply is available for HCP campaigns only.\nFAQ\nGeneral\nQ: What is an EHR?\nA\n: EHR stands for Electronic Health Record. It is a digital version of a patient’s paper chart. EHRs are real-time, digital health records that make information available instantly and securely to authorized users. While an EHR does contain the medical and treatment histories of patients, an EHR system is built to go beyond standard clinical data collected in a provider’s office, and can be inclusive of a broader view of a patient’s care.\nQ: What do HCPs use EHRs for, and how often?\nA\n: HCPs use EHRs to consult, diagnose, prescribe, and treat patients while they are in the room. HCPs spend about five hours a day within their EHR workflow.\nQ: Who has access to EHRs?\nA\n: You can target any HCP accessing their EHR platform within PulsePoint’s EHR, including MD/DO, NP/PA, and nurses.\nQ: What ad sizes are available?\nA\n: Standard ad sizes such as 160x600 and 728x90 are available for activation. Please refer to your sales rep, Account Manager, and/or Platform Solutions Manager for more options.\n>\nNOTE\n-\nPP_HealthSystemEHR\nNetwork accepts only 728X90.\nQ: How are ads served?\nA\n: Through PulsePoint’s Life application, just like every programmatic channel.\nQ: Where does the advertising appear?\nA\n: Sponsored advertising can appear throughout the EHR platform, including at the login screen, in schedules, while the patient chart is open, and when diagnosing a patient during consultations.\nQ: Where can a user activate EHR Inventory in Life?\nA\n: EHR Inventory can be activated within PulsePoint’s platform in two ways.\nThe best practice is to go to the\nDeals section of the Tactic Page\nand click\nAdd Deal\nto navigate to the\nDeals Table\n.\nFilter by\nLife Marketplace Deals\nin the\nleft-hand sidebar\n. (A)\nTo view all EHR deals, search by\nehr\n. (B)\nSpecific searches:\nFor Health Systems, users can search by the name\nPP_HealthSystemEHR\nYou can also search by an Ambulatory system name like\nVeradigm\nTo apply a deal to a tactic, click\n. (C). Then click\nat the bottom of the Deals Table, followed by saving the tactic. Click\nhere\nfor info re: setting the Tactic Base Bid Price.\nEHR inventory is also accessible within the\nEndemics\ntargeting rule; however,\nwe do not recommend activation this way\n.\nCAUTION\n-\nInvoking\nTarget EHRs\nwill target ALL EHR INVENTORY, including open auction inventory and Premium Publishers. The vastly different Floor Prices between different EHR inventories may negatively impact delivery and/or performance.\nInstead, we strongly recommend you uncheck\nTarget EHRs\nand follow the directions above under\nWhere can a user activate EHR Inventory in Life?\nClick\nhere\nfor detailed info on EHR targeting.\nQ: What targeting rules are applicable?\nA\n: All HCP-applicable targeting rules in Life, including\nHCP by Specialty\n(which is highly recommended),\nDemographics\n,\nGeo Radius\n,\nWeather Signals\n.\nQ: Do NPI Smart Lists work with EHR?\nA:\nYes.\nNPI Smart Lists\nTM\n(including\nhistorical clinical activity\n) can be used when activating EHR supply in the platform. If scale is an issue through this precision targeting tactic, your Account Manager and Campaign Manager will work with you to increase it.\nQ: Is forecasting available?\nA\n: Yes, through the Campaign Strategy team. Please refer to your sales rep and/or client strategist for more information.\nChannels\nQ: What channels are available?\nA\n: Display is the only creative type in EHR platforms. 99% of HCPs access their EHRs in desktops. Accordingly, you can target EHR inventory\nonly\nfor tactics belonging to Display line items.\nReporting\nQ: Will NPI reporting be available?\nA\n: Yes, in real-time at the campaign level and monthly through\nClinical Insights\n. For Clinical Insights reporting, the entire dashboard would reflect EHR inventory if a line item is dedicated to EHR, based on tactic configuration.\nQ: How many NPIs will Life report back on?\nA\n: Life reports back on\n100%\nof HCPs reached in real-time, while EHR platform direct buys (e.g., from Veradigm) report back on only about\n50%\nof HCPs reached.\nCompliance, Privacy\nQ: How can EHR targeting be HIPAA compliant and legal if HCPs view ads during patient care?\nA:\nThis solution does not collect patient information, nor does it serve any ads to patients. PulsePoint’s EHR partners enable targeting of HCPs only in the EHR workflow, and the PulsePoint solution will be based on targeting by the provider’s NPI, specialty and/or their treatment history. Therefore,\nno\npatient information, including diagnosis codes, will be utilized as a trigger for when advertisements appear.\nThe Practice Fusion EHR displays advertisements in a window, adjacent to the EHR workflow, that is separate and distinguishable from the clinical and practice management workflow within the EHR. As such,\nno\npatient information, patient data, PHI, or other HIPAA-covered data is collected, shared, or used.\nNo\nbiopharma or device advertisements appear during the prescribing workflow, consistent with applicable law.\nMatch Rates, Reach\nQ: What does HCP and specialty reach for targeting by specialty look like?\nA\n: We have partnered with the largest Ambulatory EHR supply in the US, and added access to Health System EHR inventory, expanding our total programmatic reach to 700K+ HCPs within EHR systems. Our Health System EHR inventory now reaches over 1,500 premier health systems.\nQ: What are the expected NPI match rates for EHR?\nA\n: At this time, our EHR partners are not passing digital NPI profiles through Life. Without these identifiers, NPI and specialty match rates in Life will look lower than normal; however, this is not unusual for inventory sources which do not normally pass back digital NPI profiles.\nTypical match rates for target lists for Ambulatory EHR inventory alone will be around\n15-20%\nof a provided NPI list when combining the EHR platform inventory types, or around\n55-75%\nif also including Health System EHR inventory.\nThere will also be little to no overlap in HCPs reached on multiple platforms since only one EHR platform is used per private practice or healthcare facility.\nQ: How can I obtain NPI match rates?\nA\n: At this time, match rates for client-provided NPI Lists will be manually defined through the Campaign Strategy team. Please refer to your sales rep and/or client strategist for more information. Because of this manual process, we cannot provide match rates for ever-changing\nNPI Smart Lists\nthat grow over time.\nEHR Health Systems Inventory: Best Practices\nQ: What is the suggested tactic Base Bid Price for EHR Health Systems inventory?\nA:\nIn order to\nbid on the inventory\n, please set tactic's\nBase Bid Price\nequal to or higher than the deal's\nfloor price\n. In addition, if the deal has a\nclearing price\n, we recommend setting the Base Bid Price to the clearing price to improve win rate and remain competitive in high-value auctions.\nQ: What is the expected impression drop-off during holidays and weekends?\nA:\nDuring holidays and weekends, impression volume typically decreases compared to standard Monday – Friday traffic. On holidays, you can expect around\n20–25%\nof the average weekday impression activity, while weekends generally see around\n30–40%\nof this average.\nProgrammatic vs. Direct Buy\nQ: Are rates the same for direct buys vs. programmatic?\nA\n: Rates are comparable for Ambulatory EHR at a range of\n$200-$300\nCPM\n, which is the standard for EHR. Health System EHR rates are\n$1000-$1200\nCPM.\nContact your account rep for more details.\nQ: Why would you choose PulsePoint to run EHR ads instead of direct buys?\nA\n: While some vendors offer direct buy opportunities for EHR advertising, they do not have in-house capabilities to automate programmatically, and PulsePoint is a preferred vendor.\nTargeting differentiators:\nMultiple EHRs support scale for greater HCP reach through multiple practices.\nNot available through single-EHR direct buys.\nOmnichannel optimization, activation and reporting offer a better unified campaign strategy.\nNot available through single-EHR direct buys.\nUnlimited targeting attributes for high-value HCPs.\nExclusive to Life.\nDynamic\nNPI Smart Lists\nautomate target lists of engaged HCPs based on real-time digital and clinical signals, layering in unique attributes for engaged NPIs.\nExclusive to Life.\nFrequency control and near real-time reporting offer greater campaign control.\nNot available through single-EHR direct buys.\nWhile\nfrequency capping\nis available programmatically, it is not recommended. If you need to use it, set it at the\nperson\nlevel.\nReporting differentiators:\nReporting is available for\n100%\nof NPIs, including clicks for all exposed, unique HCPs.\nReporting for EHR direct buys is limited to month-long lags and HCP data passback on only about\n50%\nof HCPs reached.\nReporting on clicks is not available through single-EHR direct buys.\nDaily campaign metrics, down to the time of day NPIs were exposed, are refreshed in near real-time in Life.\nNot available through single-EHR direct buys.\nClinical Insights\nprovide granular visibility into EHR campaign impact on script writing, including Rx fills.\nExclusive to Life on a monthly basis.\nQ: Why would I target multiple EHR platforms?\nA:\nHCPs use only one EHR platform per private practice, so delivering against multiple EHRs allows a brand to grow their scale and reach.",

Please see this\nprocess overview deck\nfor more information.\nChannels\nQ: What channels are available?\nA\n: Display is the only creative type available in EHR platforms. 99% of HCPs access their EHRs in desktops. Accordingly, you can target EHR inventory\nonly\nfor tactics belonging to Display line items.\nReporting\nQ: Will NPI reporting be available?\nA\n: Yes, in real-time at the campaign level and monthly through\nClinical Insights\n. For Clinical Insights reporting, the entire dashboard would reflect EHR inventory if a line item is dedicated to EHR, based on tactic configuration.\nQ: How many NPIs will Life report back on?\nA\n: Life reports back on\n100%\nof HCPs reached in real-time, while EHR platform direct buys only report back on about\n50%\nof HCPs reached.\nQ: Why is the domain showing up as Cinnamon Health in Report Builder?\nA\n: Cinnamon Health is PulsePoint's integration endpoint that enables us to have access to the health system's EHR platform.\nCompliance, Privacy\nQ: How can EHR targeting be HIPAA compliant and legal if HCPs view ads during patient care?\nA:\nThis solution does not collect patient information, nor does it serve any ads to patients. PulsePoint’s EHR partners enable targeting of HCPs only in the EHR workflow, and the PulsePoint solution will be based on targeting by the provider’s NPI, specialty and/or their treatment history. Therefore,\nno\npatient information, including diagnosis codes, will be utilized as a trigger for when advertisements appear.\nThe Practice Fusion EHR displays advertisements in an iframe window, adjacent to the EHR workflow, that is separate and distinguishable from the clinical and practice management workflow within the EHR. As such,\nno\npatient information, patient data, PHI or other HIPAA-covered data is collected, shared, or used.\nNo\nbiopharma or device advertisements appear during the prescribing workflow, consistent with applicable law.\nSetup, RFPs\nQ: How can I submit an RFP, set up EHR inventory, and get match rates for my client?\nA\n: Please refer to this\nprocess overview deck\nguide for details.\nNote that for Veradigm, creative approval is needed before going live. Contact Claude Meyer at\nclaude.meyer@veradigm.com\nto get approval.\nMatch Rates, Reach\nQ: What does HCP and specialty reach for targeting by specialty look like?\nA\n: We have partnered with the largest Ambulatory EHR supply in the US, and added access to Health System EHR inventory, expanding our total programmatic reach to 700K+ HCPs within EHR systems. Our Health System EHR inventory now reaches over 1,500 premier health systems.\nQ: What are the expected NPI match rates for EHR?\nA\n: At this time, our EHR partners are not passing digital NPI profiles through Life. Without these identifiers, NPI and specialty match rates in Life will look lower than normal; however, this is not unusual for inventory sources which do not normally pass back digital NPI profiles.\nTypical match rates for client target lists for Ambulatory EHR inventory alone will be around\n15-20%\nof a client-provided NPI list when combining the EHR platform inventory types, or around\n55-75%\nif also including Health System EHR inventory.\nThere will also be little to no overlap in HCPs reached on multiple platforms since only one EHR platform is used per private practice or healthcare facility.\nQ: How can I obtain NPI match rates for my client?\nA\n: At this time, match rates for client-provided NPI Lists will be manually defined when requested by clients through the Campaign Strategy team. Please see this\nprocess overview deck\nfor more information. Because of this manual process, we cannot provide match rates for ever-changing\nNPI Smart Lists\nthat grow over time.\nCompetitive Differentiation\nQ: What other DSPs provide EHR channel activation and reporting?\nA:\nVeradigm, in addition to working with PulsePoint, is partnering with DeepIntent and Lasso.\nEHR Health Systems Inventory: Best Practices\nQ: What is the suggested tactic Base Bid Price for EHR Health Systems inventory?\nA:\nThe floor price for targeting EHR Health Systems inventory is\n$850 CPM\n. To improve Win Rate and remain competitive in high-value auctions, we recommend setting your base bid significantly above the floor. Based on historical performance and successful campaign strategies, a bid exceeding\n$900 CPM\nis advised to maximize bid competitiveness and ensure consistent access to the inventory.\nQ: What is the expected impression drop-off during holidays and weekends?\nA:\nDuring holidays and weekends, impression volume typically decreases compared to standard Monday – Friday traffic. On holidays, you can expect around\n20–25%\nof the average weekday impression activity, while weekends generally see around\n30–40%\nof this average.\nProgrammatic vs. Direct Buy\nQ: Are rates the same for direct buys vs. programmatic?\nA\n: Rates are comparable for Ambulatory EHR at a range of\n$200-$300 CPM\n, which is the standard for EHR. Health System EHR rates are\n$1000-$1200 CPM\n.\nIf CPM is an issue since this is out of the programmatic CPM norm, we have some wiggle room to negotiate.\nQ: Why would clients choose PulsePoint to run EHR ads instead of direct buys?\nA\n: While some vendors offer direct buy opportunities for EHR advertising, they do not have in-house capabilities to automate programmatically, and PulsePoint is a preferred vendor.\nTargeting differentiators:\nMultiple EHRs support scale for greater HCP reach through multiple practices.\nNot available through single-EHR direct buys.\nOmnichannel optimization, activation and reporting offer a better unified campaign strategy.\nNot available through single-EHR direct buys.\nUnlimited targeting attributes for high-value HCPs.\nExclusive to Life.\nDynamic\nNPI Smart Lists\nautomate target lists of engaged HCPs based on real-time digital and clinical signals, layering in unique attributes for engaged NPIs.\nExclusive to Life.\nFrequency control and near real-time reporting offer greater campaign control.\nNot available through single-EHR direct buys.\nWhile\nfrequency capping\nis available programmatically, it is not recommended. If you need to use it, set it at the\nperson\nlevel.\nReporting differentiators:\n100%\nNPI reporting instantly, including clicks, for all exposed unique HCPs.\nReporting for EHR direct buys are limited to month-long lags and HCP data passback on only about\n50%\nof HCPs reached.\nReporting on clicks is not available through single-EHR direct buys.\nDaily campaign metrics, including time of day NPIs were exposed, refreshed in near real-time in Life.\nNot available through single-EHR direct buys.\nClinical Insights\nprovide granular visibility into script writing associated with EHR campaigns, including Rx fills.\nExclusive to Life on a monthly basis.\nQ: Why would I target multiple EHR platforms?\nA:\nHCPs use only one EHR platform per private practice so delivering against multiple EHRs allows a brand to grow their scale and reach.",

For DTC campaigns, refer to the pixel labeled “DTC” or “Patient”. If you have questions regarding the pixel or pixel(s), please reach out to your account manager so they can assist you.\nMake sure that “Auto-tagging” is enabled for your platform if you are planning on utilizing UTM parameters. For more information, you can refer to the links provided on page 14.\nInstructions For Implementing Your HCP365 Search Pixel:\nThere are\ntwo\noptions\nby which we recommend you place your HCP365 search pixel:\nOption 1\n:\nAccount-level Setup\n- Recommended only if your account contains only HCP, DTC or UNB\ncampaigns.\nOption 2\n:\nCampaign-level Setup\n-Recommended for if you have HCP, DTC, or UNB campaigns under the same\naccount.\n*\nThese Methods are applicable for both your\nSA360 - Google Pixel\nand your\nSA360 Bing Pixe\nl*\nAccount-Level Setup\n:\nStep 1\n:\nlook to the panel on the left-hand side of the user interface.\n-Click on the“Settings” option followed by “Account Settings”\n- Scroll down and click on the “Tracking” dropdown tab.\nStep 2\n:\nCopy/paste the following portion of the\nHCP365 search pixel script provided by your account\nmanager into the\nfirst\nbox labeled “Tracking template”\nhttps://bh.contextweb.com/bh/sr?action=add&token=VX3XL5BDTIGK&ch=2&cid=PPC-accountype:{_dsaccounttype}-campaign:{_dscampaign}-searchterm:{_dssearchterm}-adgroup:{_dsadgroup}-keywordid:{_dskeywordid}&rurl={escapedlpurl}&us_privacy=${us_privacy}&gpp=${GPP_STRING_XXXXX}&gpp_sid=${GPP_SID]\nStep 3:\nThe box labeled “Final URL Suffix” can be avoided because the auto - tagging feature will\nprovide the UTM parameters needed.\nStep 4\n:\nIt’s always a good idea to click the “Test” button as well to make sure that the code you\nhave inserted is operational.\nStep 5\n:\nOnce your Pixel is placed, click “Save”\n*IMPORTANT NOTE*\nIf you already have SA360 tracking set up and want to add your SA360 Google PulsePoint pixel into the same tracking template, this can be done by adding it onto the end of your existing tracking template and pasting it after the \"\nds_dest_url=\n\" parameter. It is also a good idea to encode our pixel\nto ensure that it remains intact, thereby preventing any potential tracking issues.\nBelow is an example of existing SA360 tracking\nbefore\nand\nafter\nadding your PulsePoint Google Search Pixel. The Pulsepoint Pixel should be encoded to ensure that it remains intact, thereby preventing any potential tracking issues.\nEXAMPLE - (Tracking Template)\nBEFORE\n:\nhttps://ad.doubleclick.net/searchads/link/click?{_dssagcrid}&ds_a_cid=123456789&ds_a_caid={campaignid}&ds_a_agid={adgroupid}&ds_a_fiid={feeditemid}&ds_a_lid={targetid}&ds_a_extid={extensionid}&{_dssftfiid}&ds_e_adid={creative}&ds_e_matchtype={ifsearch:search}{ifcontent:content}&ds_e_device={device}&ds_e_network={network}&{ifpla:ds_e_product_group_id={product_partition_id}&ds_e_product_id={product_id}&ds_e_product_merchant_id={merchant_id}&ds_e_product_country={product_country}&ds_e_product_language={product_language}&ds_e_product_channel={product_channel}&ds_e_product_store_id={store_code}}&ds_url_v=2&ds_dest_url={unescapedlpurl}\nEXAMPLE - (Tracking Template + SA360 Pulsepoint Pixel)\nAFTER\n:\nhttps://ad.doubleclick.net/searchads/link/click?{_dssagcrid}&ds_a_cid=123456789&ds_a_caid={campaignid}&ds_a_agid={adgroupid}&ds_a_fiid={feeditemid}&ds_a_lid={targetid}&ds_a_extid={extensionid}&{_dssftfiid}&ds_e_adid={creative}&ds_e_matchtype={ifsearch:search}{ifcontent:content}&ds_e_device={device}&ds_e_network={network}&{ifpla:ds_e_product_group_id={product_partition_id}&ds_e_product_id={product_id}&ds_e_product_merchant_id={merchant_id}&ds_e_product_country={product_country}&ds_e_product_language={product_language}&ds_e_product_channel={product_channel}&ds_e_product_store_id={store_code}}&ds_url_v=2&\nds_dest_url\n=\nhttps%3A%2F%2Fbh.contextweb.com%2Fbh%2Fsr%3Faction%3Dadd%26token%3DPOPYRGQBTNZL%26ch%3D2%26cid%3DPPC-accountype%3A{_dsaccounttype}-campaign%3A{_dscampaign}-searchterm%3A{_dssearchterm}-adgroup%3A{_dsadgroup}-keywordid%3A{_dskeywordid}%26rurl%3D{escapedlpurl+2}%2526us_privacy%253D${us_privacy}\nIf you have any further questions about this, please reach out to your account manager.\nCampaign-level Setup:\nIf you have all HCP, DTC, and/or UNB campaigns falling under the same account, your HCP365 Search pixels will have to be implemented separately on the campaign level so that they can be tracked under the correct HCP365 collection.\nIf that is the case, please follow the setup below:\nStep 1:\nLook to the left-hand panel and click “Campaigns”\nStep 2:\nClick into your designated campaign and look once again to the left-hand panel and\nclick “Settings” then click “Campaign Settings” - This will reveal a menu with panels.\nStep 3:\nClick on “Additional Settings” - this will create another drop-down. Next, click\non the “Campaign URL Options” tab. This will reveal two boxes:\nTracking Template\nand\nFinal URL Suffix.\nJust like the copy & paste instructions for\nStep 2\nunder “\nAccount-Level Setup”\n, the pixel can be implemented the same way. The only difference is that you will have to implement different pixels to match the campaign’s audience segment.\nAfter pasting your Google Ads pixel into the Tracking Template, make sure auto-tagging is enabled so that your UTM parameters are automatically added to the\nFinal URL Suffix.\nIf you do not have auto-tagging enabled but wish to add them automatically,\nOnce tracking has been entered, Click “Test” to make sure that your tag is functioning properly, then click “SAVE.”\nSA360 - Google / Bing Tracking Implementation\nThe same steps 1-5 li\nsted above can be applied when implementing your\nGoogle - Bing (SA360)\nPixel for tracking in SA360. Below is a brief description broken in a few steps. You can pretty much follow the instructions above if you are looking to implement on the Account level or the Campaign level.\nStep 1:\nClick on\nCopy/paste the\nG\noogle - Bing (SA360)\nscript provided by your Account Manager in\nto the “Tracking Template box\n.\nDo not include the Optional Parameters. It should look something like this:\nhttps://bh.contextweb.com/bh/sr?action=add&token=CTKQXQ18H6UB&ch=2&rurl={lpurl}&us_privacy=${us_privacy}&gpp=${GPP_STRING_XXXXX}&gpp_sid=${GPP_SID\n}\nStep 2:\nApply your UTM parameters into the Final URL Suffix box located directly below the Tracking Template. The additional parameters which are included in the pixel are optional.\n*IMPORTANT NOTE*\nIf you already have SA360 tracking set up and want to add your\nSA360-Bing\npixel into the same tracking template, this can be done by adding it onto the end of your existing tracking template and pasting it after the \"\nds_dest_url=\n\" parameter. It is also a good idea to encode our pixel\nto ensure that it remains intact, thereby preventing any potential tracking issues.\nBelow is an example of existing SA360 tracking\nbefore\nand\nafter\nadding your PulsePoint SA360-Bing Search Pixel. The Pulsepoint Pixel should be encoded to ensure that it remains intact, thereby preventing any potential tracking issues.\nEXAMPLE - (Tracking Template)\nBEFORE\n:\nhttps://ad.doubleclick.net/searchads/link/click?{_dssagcrid}&{_dssadxid}&ds_e_adid={AdId}&ds_e_target_id={TargetId}&{ifpla:ds_e_product_group_id={CriterionId}&ds_e_product_id={ProductId}&ds_e_product_country={product_country}&ds_e_product_language={product_language}&ds_e_product_channel={product_channel}}&ds_e_network={network}&ds_url_v=2&ds_dest_url=\nEXAMPLE - (Tracking Template + SA360-Bing)\nAFTER\n:\nhttps://ad.doubleclick.net/searchads/link/click?{_dssagcrid}&{_dssadxid}&ds_e_adid={AdId}&ds_e_target_id={TargetId}&{ifpla:ds_e_product_group_id={CriterionId}&ds_e_product_id={ProductId}&ds_e_product_country={product_country}&ds_e_product_language={product_language}&ds_e_product_channel={product_channel}}&ds_e_network={network}&ds_url_v=2\n&ds_dest_url=\nhttps%3A%2F%2Fbh.contextweb.com%2Fbh%2Fsr%3Faction%3Dadd%26token%3D\nCTKQXQ18H6UB\n%26ch%3D2%26rurl%3D{lpurl+2}%26us_privacy%3D${us_privacy}\nAvailable Macros:\nImplementing Your HCP365 Bing Pixel in Microsoft Ads Platform\nIn a scenario where you have a standalone setup in Microsoft Ads and you are not utilizing SA360, our team can provide you with a Bing pixel specifically designed to operate within that platform.\nJust like with SA360, your pixel can be implemented on the\nAccount Level\nor the\nCampaign Level.\nTo implement your Bing pixel, please adhere to the following Instructions:\nAccount-level Setup:\nStep 1:\nGo to the Microsoft Advertising website and log in to your account.\nStep 2\n:\nFrom the navigation menu on the left, Click on the\nCampaigns\nicon and select Settings > Account level options.\nStep 3:\nAt the bottom of the list, select Settings > Account level options.\nStep 4:\nPaste your Bing pixel script provided to you by your account manager into the “\nTracking\nTemplate”\nbox.

If not, you can apply your UTMs or additional\nparameters manually.\nImportant note to consider:\nIf you create a tracking template at the campaign, ad group, ad or sitelink extension level, it will override the account tracking template. When your ad is served, the lowest level tracking template will be appended to your landing page URL.\nImplementing your HCP365 Pixel in Google Ads:\nOur search pixel can also be implemented in google ads as well. Directions to follow are listed below.\nAccount-Level Setup:\nStep 1\n:\nLog into your Google Ads Account\nStep 2\n: Click “Settings” in the left-hand panel of the UI\nStep 3:\nSelect ‘Account Settings’ and then ‘Tracking’.

An example of the code can be seen in the directions above for Account-level implementation. Enter any custom or UTM parameters in the Final URL Suffix box.\n*If Auto-tagging is enabled, you can ignore entering UTM parameters manually*\nStep 6\n: “Test” to make sure your setup is correct and then click “Save”\nAdditional Steps To Help Pulsepoint Q/A:\nSome additional steps to help the PulsePoint team Q/A your pixel after setup would be to provide the top keywords for your ads so the team can test to make sure the pixel is recording.\nKeyword Testing:\nA Quick way for you to test to see if your ad is appearing on google would be to type in a keyword from the keyword list indicated by the red arrow below.\n*You must ensure that the keyword list is populating under the same campaign name as our pixel.*\nHCP365 Pixel Parameters and Descriptions:\nBelow is a breakout for each pixel and its components. This includes the parameter of each pixel and the description of that parameter.\n*One thing to note here is that the “Search Term” parameter captures the searches that users enter in Google or Bing which also match up the keywords on your keyword lists.\nAny searches entered by users that do not match up with your keyword list but do lead to a user clicking on your search ad need to be accrued in HCP reporting by the use of an optional parameter*\nHCP365 SA360 -

The client is responsible for running social campaigns themselves, directly on Meta’s Campaign Manager, leveraging PulsePoint curated HCP target lists..\nQ: How do you create and launch an Omnichannel Audience?\nA\n: The following steps must be followed for Omnichannel Audiences to be pushed successfully:\nBrands must complete all necessary steps in the Omnichannel Audiences setup requirements process as listed within the Billing, Legal, and Setup section on the first page of this FAQ, and must notify PulsePoint if PLD reporting is desired so the required setup steps outlined within the Billing, Legal, and Setup section can be completed.\nUpon onboarding, an intake of specific account users that need access to Omnichannel Audiences is required. User access is for the two current parts of the Omnichannel Audiences 1) audience page 2) who should have access to PLD (assuming requirements above are met).\nClients must also permit PulsePoint to access their social accounts for audience sharing purposes. To link accounts, PulsePoint Account Managers must create a Product Ops Jira ticket requesting linking. This process can take up to 24 hours.\nOnce completed, HCP audiences can then be created directly within PulsePoint’s platform, using:\nBrand-provided static NPI Lists\nCustom NPI lists created by PulsePoint on behalf of the brand (using all available HCP targeting rules)\nAny NPI SmartList type\nProfession or Specialty NPI lists\nNote: If your client has questions about creating HCP audiences, please request for support from their respective Account Managers.\nOnce HCP target lists are finalized, PulsePoint uploads them directly to a client’s social media account, and within a week, all verified and qualified HCPIs will be matched to their social media accounts and the HCP target lists will be transferred to a brand’s social Business Manager account by PulsePoint.\nFrom there, the client is responsible for associating each HCP target list with the intended campaign for targeting purposes.\nQ: Where can I access step by step instructions for how to build an HCP target list and send it to respective social platforms?\nA\n: Please\nuse this video\nto understand the step by step process for Omnichannel Audience deployment.\nDO NOT SHARE THIS WITH CLIENTS AS IT CONTAINS CLIENT DATA.\nQ: Why aren't my PulsePoint generated HCP target lists properly loading within Meta's Campaign Manager?\nA:\nPulsePoint-generated HCP target lists may fail to load or activate properly within Meta’s or LinkedIn’s campaign platforms due to minimum audience size requirements and match rate thresholds imposed by each platform. Meta requires a minimum of 1,000 matched users in a custom audience segment for activation. While PulsePoint has occasionally uploaded lists with fewer than 2,000 NPIs to Meta, performance can vary significantly, and any audience that results in fewer than 1,000 matches is typically rejected by the platform. Similarly, LinkedIn requires a minimum of 300 matched members in an audience for activation, but recommends a significantly larger match size—at least 50,000 members—for effective campaign performance.\nIn both cases, the final match rate depends heavily on the quality and completeness of the identifiers associated with each NPI, such as hashed emails or phone numbers. PulsePoint leverages NPI-based data to construct audience segments, but cannot guarantee successful activation if the platform’s minimum thresholds aren’t met, particularly when lists fall below 5,000 NPIs or have poor identifier coverage.\nTo increase the likelihood of successful activation on Meta or LinkedIn, PulsePoint recommends combining multiple smaller HCP lists into a single, larger segment within the platform prior to upload. While there is no strict minimum input size, aiming for a list with at least 5,000 to 10,000 matched NPIs is considered best practice, as it increases the potential match count and improves campaign scalability.\nIf an audience segment fails to activate on either platform, users should contact their PulsePoint representative. The representative can assist in troubleshooting match issues, optimizing the list structure, or recommending alternative targeting strategies. These may include the use of PulsePoint’s SmartLists™, which are pre-optimized for better matchability and performance across social platforms. Ultimately, while PulsePoint supports audience uploads to Meta and LinkedIn, successful activation depends on meeting each platform’s audience eligibility criteria.\nBelow is an example of what a user would see in their Meta account if their audience match is small:\nNote: Do not contact support if the audience size is below 1,000 (Internal note).\nQ: How long does it take social media platforms to match PulsePoint audiences?\nA:\nGenerally, clients may see a shell of a PulsePoint curated audience in their social Campaign Manager within 24-72 hours after the audience list is sent to the social platform. For instance, Meta’s Campaign Manager can take at least 3-5 days for a PulsePoint audience to fully populate in its platform before deploying it to an active campaign.\nQ: What happens if I toggle off an audience within our Omnichannel Audiences platform?\nA:\nWhen you toggle off an audience within our Omnichannel Audiences platform, your social campaigns on Meta continue to run, but they will stop doing any audience refreshes until you toggle on again.\nQ: What happens if HCPs are removed from a PulsePoint generated audience post-deployment?\nA\n: When HCPs are removed from a PulsePoint audience segment, we ensure those changes are reflected in the next audience sync sent to the respective social platforms. On the backend we calculate the difference between users for previous and current days then upload the difference. HCPs that were added to the segment will be added to the audience sync, HCPs that are no longer in the segment will be removed from the audience sync.\nQ: Why does Facebook show an A and a B segment after the audience starts populating? Which one should the client use?\nA\n: When audiences are pushed over, Facebook automatically creates a B segment that is web sourced.\nIt is recommended to only run the A audience.\nQ: Can we create an NPI list of CTV viewers for Smart Pixel and then retarget them on Social?\nA:\nYes we can.\nMatch rates\nQ: Are match rates available for matching an HCP in PulsePoint to their Meta accounts pre-activation?\nA\n: Match rates for HCP audiences in PulsePoint are not directly available pre-activation for platforms like Meta and LinkedIn. Instead, both platforms provide estimated audience sizes once a segment is pushed, which are based on their internal methodologies rather than exact one-to-one matches against the original list.\nFor Meta, the estimated audience size often exceeds the raw count of the HCP target list. This discrepancy arises from several factors, including automatic audience expansion tools like Advantage+ or Detailed Targeting Expansion, modeling based on partial identifier matches, and the inclusion of users across Facebook, Instagram, and the Audience Network. Additionally, Meta's audience estimation is based on Accounts Center accounts, which may consist of a single Facebook or Instagram account or multiple linked accounts across both platforms. If users have not linked their accounts in Meta’s Accounts Center, they may be counted as separate users, potentially inflating the estimate. Overall, Meta’s estimate reflects potential reach based on ad placement and targeting settings, rather than an exact match count to the submitted list.\nSimilarly, for LinkedIn, the estimated target audience size may also exceed the size of the original PulsePoint list. This is due to factors such as automatic audience expansion, modeling from partial matches, and inclusion of users across LinkedIn and its Audience Network. Like Meta, LinkedIn’s estimation methodology is designed to project potential reach and delivery outcomes based on broader platform dynamics and targeting parameters, rather than directly mirroring the number of matched individuals from the original NPI list.\nIn both cases, these estimates are indicative of potential campaign scale and are not intended to serve as precise pre-activation match rates. Therefore, while PulsePoint does not provide pre-activation match reporting specific to LinkedIn or Meta, advertisers can interpret the estimated audience size as a directional proxy for how their segments may perform, keeping in mind that these figures incorporate modeling and expansion techniques unique to each platform.\nMeasurement\nQ: Is Physician-Level Data (PLD) reporting available for Omnichannel Audiences?\nA\n: Impression reporting is not available in PulsePoint’s platform since ad impressions are tracked within external platforms (e.g. Meta and LinkedIn) where activation is taking place. Users can get campaign impression data directly within those platforms on a daily basis.\nIf clients would like to receive Physician-Level Data (PLD) Omnichannel Audience reporting and dashboard access from PulsePoint, they must work with PulsePoint to properly tag their ads and sites according to our\nSmart Pixel implementation guide\n, and\nadd custom UTM parameters\nbefore the social campaign is launched, or opt into PulsePoint’s HCP365 analytics and onboarding requirements.\nNote: The custom parameters appended to your ads’ clickthrough URL will NOT interfere with ad delivery or reporting on social platforms, Google Analytics and other reporting platforms that you use. This parameter is solely used by PulsePoint to identify which of your campaigns have utilized audiences generated on PulsePoint’s platform, and it won't impact your existing tracking or analytics setup.\nAdhering to these PLD reporting setup instructions will ensure clients receive the most accurate data retrieval, and include visibility to granular HCP insights reported with that pixel, including the following dimensions from social platforms’ campaign manager:\nNPI NUMBER\nDAY\nTIME STAMP\nDEVICE TYPE\nOS\nCAMPAIGN ID\nCAMPAIGN NAME\nADSET ID\nADSET NAME\nPRIMARY SPECIALTY\nPROFESSION\nHOSPITAL AFFILIATION\nPRACTICE AFFILIATION\nMEDICAL SCHOOL\nAGE\nGENDER\nAD ID\nAD NAME\nUTM CAMPAIGN\nUTM MEDIUM\nUTM SOURCE\nUTM TERM\nUTM CONTENT\nREPORTING SOURCE\nPAGE URL\nNote: Omnichannel Audience reporting will not be available within PulsePoint’s standard Report Builder. Custom reports, customizations or SFTP connections are not available at this time. We are actively working to develop custom templates and custom destinations, and an ETA will be shared once those are ready. AMs will not be supporting any requests for manually building custom reporting, except for clients who were grandfathered in from the Meta/LinkedIn Beta.\nQ: What level of access to reporting for programmatic campaigns will social teams have, and vice versa?\nA:\nProgrammatic and social campaign reporting are separately provisioned. We have account level, everything. Depending on the client’s request, we can provision access at the user-level or account-level for programmatic and social campaign reporting separately.\nFor additional questions regarding access to reporting, please contact Donovan Ly (PM) and cc your respective AMs.\nNote: if you are not permissioned to see NPI level details with PII information, then you cannot access the self-serve version of PLD reporting in the Omnichannel Audiences platform. You can go through your sales rep and Account Manager to obtain reporting that blinds NPI-level details. We are actively working on the capability to blind / unblind NPI-level details in PLD reporting so all users can access the self-serve version of PLD reporting, and an ETA will be shared once it is ready.\nQ: What if PulsePoint PLD reporting data doesn’t match results from external platform reporting?\nA:\nPulsePoint’s PLD reporting captures verified HCP activity only after a user lands on a brand’s website, assuming proper Custom UTM tagging and pixel implementation instructions are followed. It measures HCPs exposed on-site, not impressions or ad clicks tracked by external platforms (e.g. Meta and LinkedIn), and therefore should not be directly compared to those metrics.\nInstead, PLD reporting provides a deeper view of HCP attributes for those that have landed on a brand’s site after exposure to a campaign run on an external platform (e.g. Meta and LinkedIn).\nQ: Why do the PLD widget totals sometimes differ within the Omnichannel reporting dashboard?\nA:\nSome differences in totals across the PLD dashboard may occur because we don’t always have complete data for every HCP. For example, a provider might appear in overall counts but be excluded from certain views if specific details—like age or gender—are missing.\nForecasting\nQ: How can a user forecast for Omnichannel Audiences?\nA\n: Since the actual campaign is set up and run by the client within their own social media Business Manager account, clients can use their social media platform’s forecasting tool to predict impressions, clicks, etc.\nPricing\nQ: How are Omnichannel Audiences priced?\nA\n: Omnichannel Audience pricing can be found\nhere\n. If the account pricing does not align with PulsePoint’s pricing, AMs are responsible for calculating the total social fee, using the impression data the client shares with us during reconciliation, as agreed upon within the client’s IO.\nIn June, blended pricing will be available in Looker when pulling reporting. In August, blended pricing will be available in UI when audiences are generated. Blended pricing is calculated based on the HCP segments used by the client.\nQ: Is there a minimum spend required to use Omnichannel Audiences?\nA:\nNo.\nActivation / Contact\nQ: How can a user request access to Omnichannel Audiences?\nA\n: Upon client request to sales reps, please inform your dedicated AM. Your AM will go through intake questions with you. The information and instructions collected in the intake questions will then be given to Becky Hallam and PSM to have Omnichannel Audiences enabled after submitting the mandatory\nlegal Omnichannel Audiences addendum\n.\nQ: What if the employee who authenticated access for Omnichannel Audiences is deactivated?\nA\n: Deactivating the authenticated user will break the connection with the social platform API to sync audiences. Please re-autheticate with another user who has the correct access. Once authenticated, please let your PulsePoint account manager know.\nAppendix\nClients with PII Access\nClients without PII Access\nData Management > Omnichannel\nAudience Tab\nPhysician Level Data Tab\nChart and Table Views\nAccount/User permissions\nNo access to Omnichannel today in the UI\nLists > Npi Lists\nCurrent Reporting Capabilities\nFuture Reporting Capabilities\nIn platform dashboard under Physician Level Data\nOverview\nTop Specialty\nTop Age Group\nTop Device Type\nTop Specialties\nAge Distribution\nGender Distribution\nChannel Overlap\nNPIs by geography\nNPIs by State\nScheduled Reports\nCustom Reports\nCustom Destinations\nAnalytics Dashboard\nImpressions\nClicks\nData Cost\nTable view under Physician Level Data\nDate\nTime\nCampaign ID\nPlatform\nCampaign Name\nAdGroup Name\nAdGroup ID\nAd ID\nAd Name\nAudience ID\nAudience Name\nNPI\nPrimary Specialty\nDevice Type\nOS\nUTM Campaign\nUTM Content\nUTM Medium\nUTM Source\nUTM Term\nAge\nGender\nMedical School\nTimestamp\n*The above can be downloaded adhoc at any time via a download button in the platform\n*both options above can be viewed with a custom date range\nThere is no customization options at this time\n==============\nRequired Omnichannel Audiences Criteria\nUser specific criteria:\nOmnichannel Audiences: Pushing PulsePoint curated HCP audiences to all social platforms is a self-service/self-service+ only offering.\nCampaign type criteria:\nHCP Only:  Omnichannel Audiences is available for HCP campaigns only\nOmnichannel Audiences Billing, Legal, and Setup specific criteria:\nNew clients/clients who are new to using Omnichannel Audiences need to sign a\nlegal addendum\n;\nIt is a requirement for all clients to sign a legal addendum to grant PulsePoint permission to push audience data\n(e.g. audience attributes like demographics)\ninto a client’s social account\n.\nAddendum -\nRequires clients to send us reporting at the end of every month showing daily campaign-to-date data, used for billing.

      "content": "Required Omnichannel Audiences Criteria\nUser specific criteria:\nOmnichannel Audiences: Pushing PulsePoint curated HCP audiences to Meta is a self-service/self-service+ only offering.\nOmnichannel Audiences Billing, Legal, and Setup specific criteria:\nIf clients are new to using Omnichannel Audiences (Meta), they need to sign a\nlegal addendum\n; It is a requirement to sign a legal addendum to grant PulsePoint permission to push audience data (e.g. audience attributes like demographics) into a Meta account (Facebook/Instagram).\nAddendum -\nUsers are required to send PulsePoint reporting at the end of every month showing daily campaign-to-date data, used for billing. This only needs to be signed once at the advertiser level.\nUsers must also grant PulsePoint access to each brand’s Meta accounts for linking, following\nthese instructions\n.\nTo enable Physician-Level Data ( PLD) reporting for Omnichannel Audiences (Meta), clients require 2 things:\nClients must work with the PulsePoint team prior to campaign deployment to place all necessary\nSmart Pixels\non all relevant ads and sites. If Smart Pixels are already in place on your ads/site, you do not need to retag it.\nAdditional Custom\nUTM parameters\nmust be applied to all applicable social ads and landing pages. Clients must request setup from their PulsePoint representative so they can implement it for you prior to campaign launch.\nUpon onboarding, an intake of specific account users that need access to Omnichannel Audiences & NPI List Management is required. User access is for the two current parts of Omnichannel Audiences 1) audience page 2) who should have access to PLD (assuming requirements above are met).\nFAQ\nGeneral\nQ: What are Omnichannel Audiences?\nA:\nOmnichannel Audiences tap into PulsePoint’s industry-leading HCP identity graph and proprietary DirectMatch™ technology to create highly customized, verified HCP target lists. These authenticated HCP target lists enable precise media activation across integrated social platforms, including Meta (Facebook and Instagram).\nNote: Users can build HCP audiences within PulsePoint’s platform, and PulsePoint pushes the audiences directly into that user’s defined Meta account manager via API. Users are responsible for running social campaigns themselves, directly on Meta’s Campaign Manager, leveraging PulsePoint curated HCP target lists.\nQ: Can Omnichannel Audiences support DTC and HCP?\nA\n: HCP Only: Omnichannel Audiences (Meta - Facebook/Instagram) is available for HCP campaigns only\nQ: How do you create and launch an Omnichannel Audience?\nA\n: The following steps must be followed for Omnichannel Audiences to be pushed successfully:\nClients must complete all necessary steps in the Omnichannel Audiences setup requirements process as listed within the Billing, Legal, and Setup section on the first page of this FAQ, and must notify PulsePoint if PLD reporting is desired so the required setup steps outlined within the Billing, Legal, and Setup section can be completed.\nUpon onboarding, an intake of specific account users that need access to Omnichannel Audiences is required. User access is for the two current parts of the Omnichannel Audiences:\nAudience page\nWho should have access to PLD (assuming requirements above are met).\nUsers must also permit PulsePoint to access their Meta accounts for audience sharing purposes. To link accounts, PulsePoint Account Managers must create a Product Ops Jira ticket requesting linking. This process can take up to 24 hours.\nOnce completed, HCP audiences can then be created directly within PulsePoint’s platform following\nthese instructions\n. HCP audiences can be created using 4 methods:\nBrand-provided static NPI Lists\nCustom NPI lists created by PulsePoint on behalf of the brand (using all available HCP targeting rules)\nAny NPI SmartList type\nProfession or Specialty NPI lists\nOnce HCP target lists are finalized, users can push the list to their Meta ad account following\ninstructions here\n, and within a week, all verified and qualified HCPIs will be matched to their social media accounts and the HCP target lists will be transferred to a brand’s social Business Manager account by PulsePoint.\nFrom there, users are responsible for associating each HCP target list with the intended campaign for targeting purposes.\nQ: Where can I access step by step instructions for how to build an HCP target list and send it to Meta?\nA\n: Please follow instructions\nhere\nin PulsePoint Knowledge Base for users.\nQ: What is the recommended audience size of the HCP target list to be uploaded to Meta?\nA:\nMeta requires a minimum of 1,000 matched audience size for a segment to be eligible for activation. If your HCP matched audience is too small or results in a low match rate, Meta may not allow the audience to be used. PulsePoint cannot guarantee successful audience creation due to restrictions from Meta on audience sizes when the matched NPI audience from PulsePoint is below 5,000. While we’ve successfully uploaded lists under 2,000 NPIs, performance can vary depending on list quality and identifier coverage.\nIf you have multiple smaller lists, we recommend combining them into a single segment within the PulsePoint platform before upload to improve match success. While there’s no fixed minimum input size, uploading lists with at least 5,000–10,000 matched NPIs is considered best practice for scalability and success.\nIf your audience fails to activate in Meta, please contact your PulsePoint representative. We can assist with optimization or recommend additional audience strategies like SmartLists™ or support, but we cannot guarantee all segments pushed to Meta will be eligible for activation.\nQ: How long does it take Meta’s Campaign Manager to match PulsePoint audiences?\nA:\nUsers may see a shell of a PulsePoint curated audience in their social Campaign Manager within 24-72 hours after the audience list is sent to the social platform. Meta’s Campaign Manager can take at least 3-5 days for a PulsePoint audience to fully populate in its platform before deploying it to an active campaign.\nQ: What happens if I toggle off an audience within the Omnichannel Audiences platform?\nA:\nWhen you toggle off an audience within our Omnichannel Audiences platform, your social campaigns on Meta continue to run, but they will stop doing any audience refreshes until you toggle on again.\nQ: What happens if HCPs are removed from a PulsePoint generated Meta audience post-deployment?\nA\n: If HCPs are removed from an Omnichannel Audience target list within PulsePoint’s platform, the target list in Meta’s platforms will remove those HCPs from their target list as well, within 24 hours.\nQ: Why does Facebook show an A and a B segment after the audience starts populating? Which one should the client use?\nA\n: When audiences are pushed over, Facebook automatically creates a B segment that is web sourced.\nIt is recommended to only run the A audience.\nQ: Can we create an NPI list of CTV viewers for Smart Pixel and then retarget them on Social?\nA: Yes we can.\nReporting\nQ: Is Physician-Level Data (PLD) reporting available for Omnichannel Audiences?\nA\n: If you would like to receive Physician-Level Data (PLD) Omnichannel Audience reporting and dashboard access from PulsePoint, you must work with PulsePoint to properly tag ads and sites according to our\nSmart Pixel implementation guide\n, and\nadd custom UTM parameters\nbefore the social campaign is launched, or opt into PulsePoint’s HCP365 analytics and onboarding requirements. Once you are set up to access PLD reporting, you can download ad hoc reports at any time via the download button in our Omnichannel Audiences reporting and dashboard UI.\nNote: Omnichannel Audience reporting will not be available within PulsePoint’s standard Report Builder. Custom reports, scheduled reports or SFTP connections are not available at this time. We are actively working to develop reporting scheduling and customization features, and an ETA will be shared once those are ready. Currently, we will not support any news requests for manually building custom reporting.\nQ: What data dimensions does Physician-Level Data (PLD) reporting support for Omnichannel Audiences?\nAdhering to PLD reporting setup instructions outlined above will ensure clients receive the most accurate data retrieval, and include visibility to granular HCP insights reported with that pixel, including the following dimensions, updated to reflect the latest data provided to PulsePoint from Meta’s campaign manager:\nNPI NUMBER\nDAY\nTIME STAMP\nDEVICE TYPE\nOS\nCAMPAIGN ID\nCAMPAIGN NAME\nADSET ID\nADSET NAME\nPRIMARY SPECIALTY\nPROFESSION\nHOSPITAL AFFILIATION\nPRACTICE AFFILIATION\nMEDICAL SCHOOL\nAGE\nGENDER\nAD ID\nAD NAME\nUTM CAMPAIGN\nUTM MEDIUM\nUTM SOURCE\nUTM TERM\nUTM CONTENT\nREPORTING SOURCE\nPAGE URL\nQ: Does PLD reporting support impression-level reporting?\nImpression reporting is not available in PulsePoint’s platform since ad impressions are tracked within external platforms (e.g. Meta) where activation is taking place. Users can get campaign impression data directly within those platforms on a daily basis. We are actively building dashboard reporting capabilities to display impressions, clicks and data costs. An ETA will be shared once those are ready.\nQ: How does Omnichannel Audiences respect varying levels of PII sensitivity in its reporting for programmatic vs social campaigns?\nA:\nProgrammatic and social campaign reporting are separately provisioned. We have account level, everything. Depending on the client’s request, we can provision access at the user-level or account-level for programmatic and social campaign reporting separately.\nHowever, if you are not permissioned to see NPI level details with PII information, then you cannot access the self-serve version of PLD reporting in the Omnichannel Audiences platform. You can go through your sales rep and Account Manager to obtain reporting that blinds NPI-level details. We are actively working on the capability to blind / unblind NPI-level details in PLD reporting so all users can access the self-serve version of PLD reporting, and an ETA will be shared once it is ready.\nQ: What if PulsePoint PLD reporting data doesn’t match results from external platform reporting?\nA:\nPulsePoint’s PLD reporting captures verified HCP activity only after a user lands on a brand’s website, assuming proper Custom UTM tagging and pixel implementation instructions are followed. It measures HCPs exposed on-site, not impressions or ad clicks tracked by external platforms (e.g. Meta), and therefore should not be directly compared to those metrics.\nInstead, PLD reporting provides a deeper view of HCP attributes for those that have landed on a brand’s site after exposure to a campaign run on an external platform (e.g. Meta).\nQ: Why do the PLD widget totals sometimes differ within the Omnichannel reporting dashboard?\nA:\nSome differences in totals across the PLD dashboard may occur because we don’t always have complete data for every HCP. For example, a provider might appear in overall counts but be excluded from certain views if specific details—like age or gender—are missing.\nMatch rates\nQ: Are match rates available for matching an HCP in PulsePoint to their Meta accounts pre-activation?\nA\n: Omnichannel Audience match rates and the estimated audience size targeted via each external platform (e.g. Meta) will vary depending on the HCP target lists used, the targeting methodology used by the platform, and the number of accounts users are targeted on within each platform.\nMeta provides an Estimated Audience Size based on their methodology to size an audience that PulsePoint sends them. In many cases, it is more than the target list count. This is due to factors like automatic audience expansion (e.g., Advantage+ or Detailed Targeting Expansion), modeling based on partial matches, inclusion of users across Facebook, Instagram and Audience Network, as well as estimation methods that account for potential reach rather than exact list size. These estimates often reflect broader targeting and delivery assumptions rather than a strict match to your original audience.\nOn top of that, Meta’s Estimated Audience Size generally estimates how many Accounts Center accounts meet the targeting and ad placement criteria that advertisers select while creating an ad. An Accounts Center account refers to either (1) an individual Facebook or Instagram account that has not been added to the same Accounts Center as another account, (2) the two or more Facebook and Instagram accounts that have been added to the same Accounts Center. For users that have unlinked their FaceBook and Instagram accounts, these may be double counted as separate users.\nForecasting\nQ: How can a user forecast for Omnichannel Audiences?\nA\n: Since the actual campaign is set up and run by the client within their own social media Business Manager account, clients can use their social media platform’s forecasting tool to predict impressions, clicks, etc.\nActivation / Contact\nQ: How can a user request access to Omnichannel Audiences?\nA\n: Please inform your dedicated Sales rep and AM. Also, please submit the mandatory\nlegal Omnichannel Audiences addendum\n. Your AM will go through intake questions with you, which are used to set up the appropriate user access to Omnichannel Audiences (Meta).",

It applies to all client types (SS and SS+) and for both DTC and HCP campaign types.\nFAQ\nGeneral\nWhat is the Deals release?\nPreviously, managing deals required navigating across multiple pages and workﬂows, making it more time-consuming to apply and troubleshoot deals. Deals simpliﬁes this process—centralizing deal creation, activation, and insights in one place for greater efﬁciency, visibility, and control.\nWhere can I access and manage deals in the updated platform interface?\nYou can now access Deals via\nPulsePoint Menu --> Deals\n. (See above.) This new tab replaces the legacy “Private Deals” screen and consolidates all deal-related actions—create, edit, and manage—into one streamlined interface. It retains all key functionality from the old workﬂow while adding enhanced controls and performance insights.\nWhat are the core capabilities of the Deals page?\nUniﬁed Deal Experience\n– All deals (Premium Publisher, Health Markets, and Private) are now managed from a single screen under\nTactic Settings > Deals\n.\nSeamless Private Deal Creation\n– No need to leave the workﬂow—create and apply Private Deals directly within the new deals modal.\nDeeper Data Insights\n– New data points such as Est. Avails, Clearing Bid, Creative Sizes, Domains and Apps, Min/Max Video and Audio Lengths, and Media Types provide granular transparency to help troubleshoot and maximize spend.\nMore Control & Customization\n– Users can now search, ﬁlter, and bulk apply deals across multiple campaigns, making planning and optimizations easier than ever.\nWill I still have access to the previous deal management workﬂow?\nNo, users will lose access to the previous deal management workﬂow upon the release of Deals.\nWhat are some of the key features within Deals?\nDeals is intended to simplify the deal management process. The new features include:\nAll Deals Tab\n: See all available deals (Private Deals, premium publisher, and LIFE Marketplace Deals) in one place.\nPremium Publisher and Health Market deals are now called “LIFE Marketplace Deals”.\n“Compatible with Tactic” Toggle\n: View which deals match your line item's advertiser and media type, with the option to view all deals available to the account.\nCreate Private Deals within Tactic Editor\n: No need to leave the page.\nArchive Private Deals\n: Easily archive and ﬁlter by active vs. archived deals.\nStreamlined Deal Targeting Options\n: Toggle between “Only Target Applied Deals” or target deals and open exchange.\nWhat are some of the key insights within deals?\nWith the launch of this product, multiple additions have been made to increase the deal insights and performance data visible within a deal.\nEst. Avails Data – estimated available bid requests for a deal\nFilter by Yesterday, last 7 days, last 30 days avails.\nBid Request Data:\nDomains & Apps\nCreative Sizes\nMedia Types\nMax/Min Video Duration\nMax/Min Audio Duration\nBid Performance Data:\nAverage clearing bid price won for a single deal across all tactics and accounts\nAverage clearing bid price won for multiple (selected) deals across all tactics and accounts\nAre there any options to search within Deals?\nYes! Additional capabilities to search across all deals in the account are available, with search options existing for both deal name or Deal ID.\nAre there any options to ﬁlter and sort within Deals?\nYes! Multiple options to ﬁlter have been added to ﬁlter and search deals within an account.\nFilter by:\nExchange\nChannel\nFloor Price Range\nEst. Avails\nAccepted Video Duration (any duration, 6s, 15s…120s+)\nAccepted Audio Duration (any duration, 6s, 15s…120s+)\nDevice Type\nAd Size\nSort by:\nEst. Avails\nClearing Price\nFloor Price\nDeal Name\nHow can I add or override deals to multiple tactics at once?\nYou can bulk add or override deals by going to the Campaigns Table > Bulk Actions or navigating to Campaign > Line Item > Bulk Edit Mode.\nHow can users view and manage which tactics are targeting a speciﬁc deal?\nUsers can see which tactics are targeting a deal through the\nAssociated Tactics\nlist. They can also remove a deal from a tactic directly from this list.\nHow are expired deals handled in the platform?\nExpired deals are clearly ﬂagged in the user interface, and they cannot bid outside of their designated start and end dates.\nWhat does \"Deal Info Not Available\" mean?\n“Deal Info Not Available” means no bid requests have been observed with that deal ID—the platform has not yet received any data on the deal.\nIf I add a new deal, how long does it take before bids appear in Deals?\nIt typically takes about 1 day for bid data to populate in the Deals UI. \"Yesterday’s Avail\" ﬁlter allows users to view complete data from the previous day.\nIf I add a new private deal, can I retroactively see stats for that deal ID?\nNo, statistics will only be collected from the moment the deal is added. Historical data is not available retroactively.\nWhere can I ﬁnd recommended deals?\nThe Recommended Deals feature has been removed. Previously, it suggested deals based on media type, advertiser compatibility, and ﬂoor price vs. average bid price. Since the new PMP UI includes better ﬁltering options like the \"Compatible with This Tactic\" checkbox and Floor Price ﬁlters, recommended deals became redundant.\nMethodology and Data\nWhat does the \"Timeframe\" (Last 7-day, 30-day, etc.) mean?\nThe timeframe represents the period over which statistics are aggregated, such as the last 7 or 30 days. Today’s data is excluded.\nAre the Est. Avails based on what’s sent by an SSP?\nYes, note there may be some variances as the Avails are projected using sampling data.\nWhat does the \"Compatible with Tactic\" ﬁlter mean?\nThis ﬁlter ensures that the deal aligns with the line item's advertiser and media type, displaying only deals that are compatible with the selected tactic.\nWhat does \"Deal Info Not Available\" mean?\n“Deal Info Not Available” means no bid requests have been observed with that deal ID—the platform has not yet received any data on the deal.\nWhy does the Clearing Bid ﬁeld show \"--\" when Est. Avails are present?\nA clearing bid will display \"--\" if there are no impressions won for that deal within the selected timeframe.",

      "content": "NOTE\nThe content below is as of 7/31/2025. For subsequent changes, please see:\nDTC Clinical Insights External PDF\nRequired DTC Clinical Insights Criteria:\nFollowing these guidelines will provide the most effective DTC Clinical Insights reporting.\nUser speciﬁc criteria:\nSetup of the DTC Clinical Insights dashboard will be an internally activated service (e.g., AM/PSMs).\nSS and SS+ users with the below criteria will be able to access the dashboard after their PulsePoint AM/PSM completes activation on the client’s behalf.\nCampaign speciﬁc criteria:\nClients to ﬁll out:\nDrug (required), Market Basket Drug (optional), Diagnosis Code (required)\nNOTE\n- This feature is only compatible with ICD-10 codes.\nTerms in Use\nDigital Identiﬁer\n- Data signals used to represent a user or entity online.\nFAQ\nGeneral\nWhat is the DTC Clinical Insights dashboard?\nThe DTC Clinical Insights dashboard is PulsePoint’s in-house DTC campaign media effectiveness tool, offering valuable data to measure campaign efﬁcacy and optimize targeting mid-ﬂight. It provides insights into key metrics most important to pharma clients, such as prescription lift and ensuring campaigns drive meaningful outcomes.\nWhat makes PulsePoint’s DTC Clinical Insights unique?\nIt’s the only media effectiveness solution built for DTC, giving you near real-time data to guide mid-ﬂight optimization and drive performance. Our dashboard shows how your media is performing directly in platform with line item granularity so you can adjust delivery, shift budgets, and drive better outcomes.\nYou mentioned “Media Effectiveness” above. What is the difference between that and Measurement?\nMedia effectiveness allows for quicker insights and learnings about how your media is doing within the platform in near real-time. It helps connect the ad exposure with clinical behavior to highlight the effectiveness of the media on top-line clinical impact like target validation and initial receptivity/impact.\nMeasurement goes beyond media effectiveness by proving long-term value and accountability. By stitching together CRM data, real-world clinical outcomes, and full-ﬂight media exposure, measurement delivers a long-view analysis of brand impact while enabling objective, third-party validation across trusted sources.\nWhat are the requirements for clinical data to appear on the dashboard?\nDrug name and ICD-10 codes at a minimum need to be inputted under Campaign Details. Note: there is a ~30-day clinical data delay to load in the dashboard and there must be a minimum audience count of 100 for data to populate.\nExample: The 30-day delay only affects the last date of the measurement period. If they activate the dashboard on 7/16, they will see data on 7/16 for 1/1 to 6/16.\nOnce properly set up and activated, when will I start to see data populate within the dashboard?\nCampaign impression data will only be shown if/when more than 100 exposed qualiﬁed individuals are reached. For any campaigns that have been running prior to July 2025 that opt to turn on DTC Clinical Insights, once set up correctly and turned on, data will be back ﬁlled from the campaign launch date.\nIt will also take approximately 24 hours before data will show in the dashboard.\nWhat is the lag time for clinical data in the dashboard?\nThere is a 30-day lag in the dashboard for clinical data to appear.\nExample: The 30-day delay only affects the last date of the measurement period. If the dashboard is activated on 7/16, you will see data on 7/16 from the start of the campaign to 6/16.\nIs the dashboard able to be downloaded?\nYes, a PDF or zipped folder of CSV ﬁles of the dashboard can be downloaded which consists of the information available within the visuals on the dashboard, but not the raw data.\nCan the dashboard be ﬁltered by tactic?\nNo. Currently, the dashboard is available on the campaign level with the ability to ﬁlter down to a line item.\nIs the DTC Clinical Insights dashboard available for cookieless campaigns?\nYes, alternative digital identiﬁers are used in place of cookies for audience impressions measured by the dashboard. While the same dashboard methodology applies to cookieless campaigns, there may be a higher drop-off in measurable audiences if a signiﬁcant amount of impressions cannot be associated with an alternative ID.\nWhat is the date range for the data in the dashboard?\nThe dashboard by default will show data from the start of the campaign or line item till the last date we have clinical data. With the time frame selector, the measurement period can be adjusted to a speciﬁc range of dates. Note: There is a 30-day clinical data delay and the minimum audience size for demographic data to appear is 100.\nCan I select a custom date range to view in Clinical Insights?\nYes, as long as it is within the duration of the campaign or selected line item. Currently, the metrics that will be adjusted with the custom date range are limited to the Average Frequency, Cost Pers, Prescriptions and Demographic Breakdown.\nHow often is the dashboard refreshed?\nWhile prescription data will reﬂect activity from four weeks prior, updates occur weekly on Thursday and Friday and do not necessarily take a full month for numbers to change.\nMethodology and Data\nCan I change diagnosis codes after I activate the DTC Clinical Insights Dashboard?\nYes, these can be changed but this action will reset measurement on the whole dashboard. The dashboard will backﬁll the data against the new inputs. Refresh time is still ~24 hours.\nCan you have one drug applied and several ICD-10 codes?\nYes, we will look across all the diagnoses for audience qualiﬁcation.\nHow do you know if your AQ score is “good”?\nThe dashboard will have an index so clients can see the score compared to a baseline. This baseline is derived from the prevalence of the inputted diagnosis codes within PulsePoint’s prescription universe.\nHow is the index for AQ score determined?\nThe index is a PulsePoint exclusive baseline, determined through using our prescription universe to look at the prevalence of conditions the client is interested in, removing audience exposure.\nActivation\nHow can I activate the DTC Clinical Insights dashboard?\nThe DTC Clinical Insights dashboard is activated internally by an authorized user. To enable it for a client, the internal user can enter the Brand Drug Name, Diagnosis Codes for Qualiﬁcation, and Market Basket Drugs (if any are applicable) on the Campaign Details page. From there, check the \"Enable DTC Clinical Insights\" box to activate the dashboard and make a new \"Clinical Insights\" tab visible at the Campaign Level, where the dashboard will be housed.\nIs there any difference between how I should think about ICD-10 codes for DTC Clinical Insights vs the ICD-10 codes I input for Adaptive Optimization: Audience Quality?\nCampaign level clinical insights ICD-10 codes:\nShould be the overarching codes/diagnoses the advertiser wants to measure for how effective their media spend is against the target condition(s)\nTactic-level AO AQ\n: Should be the codes/diagnoses the advertiser wants the tactic to optimize against to increase AQ for the given tactic.\nDashboard\nIs NRx any new RX that is not a reﬁll? Does NRx include NBRx?\nNRx includes NBRx and renewals but not reﬁlls.\nWhat do you mean by \"new\" exposed qualiﬁed audience?\nThe ﬁrst time an exposed qualiﬁed digital identiﬁer was reached.\nNOTE\nMore definitions can be found below.\nUser Guide\nInputs to the dashboard can be conﬁgured under Campaign Details by an internal user. In order to render the dashboard, we require a Brand Drug Name and a set of ICD-10 codes to determine qualiﬁcation.\nAlthough not required, it is highly recommended to include any Market Basket or Competitor drugs, if appropriate.\nDashboard inputs:\nYou can input the Brand Drug, Market Basket Drugs (if any), and Diagnosis Codes on this screen.\nAfter the relevant inputs are added to the campaign’s details, enabling the checkbox at the bottom will trigger the campaign to be measured through the dashboard.\nOnce the inputs have been conﬁgured, a tab at the campaign level called “Clinical Insights” will show up. This tab will house the DTC Clinical Insights dashboard.\nFiltering the dashboard:\nFilter deﬁnitions:\nLine Item Filter\n- Filters the data in the dashboard down to a single line item under the campaign.\nTime Frame\n- This custom date range selector ﬁlters the data down to the requested measurement period. If you would like to ﬁlter the dashboard down to a single range, select “is in range”, and enter starting and ending dates.\nTrendline\n- You can include weekends and holidays as their own days on the trend line graph by selecting “Show all dates”, or appending their counts to the previous workday by selecting “Append weekends and holidays to workdays”. Claims data is generally zero on weekends/holidays which can cause dips in the graph.\nData Granularity\n- Adjusts the trend line graph to show daily, weekly, and monthly aggregations.\nCampaign Duration\n- Total duration of the campaign or line item(s) if ﬁltered.\nMeasurement Period\n- Start of the campaign until the most recent date clinical data is available, unless a custom date range is selected. Clinical data is refreshed weekly with a four-week lag. If the campaign started less than four weeks ago, data will not yet be visible in the dashboard.\nAudience Deﬁnitions:\nTotal Audience\n- The total digital identiﬁers exposed to the campaign or line item within the measurement period.\nMeasured Audience\n- The number of digital identiﬁers that can be mapped to our claims universe and were exposed to the campaign or line item within the measurement period.\nPLEASE NOTE: The overlap between total and measured audiences will never likely be 100%. We anticipate this to fall somewhere between 30% and 70% as the exposure needs to be tied to an anonymized individual, a corresponding claim, and be validated for it to be considered “measured”.\nExposed Qualiﬁed Audience\n- The number of digital identiﬁers who have received a diagnosis for one or more of the targeted ICD-10 codes, can be matched to a digital identiﬁer within the clean room, and were exposed to the campaign or line item within the measurement period.\nTotal Qualiﬁed Audience:\nThe total number of digital identiﬁers who have received a diagnosis for one or more of the targeted ICD-10 codes and can be mapped to our claims universe.\nAudience Quality\n- The percentage of digital identiﬁers who have been exposed to the campaign or line item, can be mapped to a digital identiﬁer within the clean room, and who have received a diagnosis for one or more of the targeted ICD-10 codes, as compared to the total number of digital identiﬁers who have been exposed to the campaign or line item and can be mapped to a digital identiﬁer:\nAudience Quality Index\n- The index of the campaign or line item’s audience quality when compared to the baseline prevalence of the targeted ICD-10 codes in our claims universe. An index greater than 1 indicates that the campaign or line item performed above baseline in terms of reaching visitors with a diagnosis for one or more of the targeted ICD-10 codes.\nAverage Frequency\n- The average number of impressions delivered per day to an exposed qualiﬁed audience member with a prescription for the brand drug, a diagnosis for the targeted ICD-10 codes, and a mapped digital identiﬁer.\nPrescriptions deﬁnitions:\nTRx\n- Total Prescriptions Filled.\nNRx\n- New Prescriptions ﬁlled (new or renewals, but not reﬁlls).\nNBRx\n- New-to-Brand Prescriptions ﬁlled. A prescription is counted as NBRx if the audience has not been prescribed the selected drug in the 12 months before the new prescription.\nPrescription Average Cost deﬁnitions-*:\nThe average cost across all metrics is calculated based on the total campaign cost, encompassing both measurable and unmeasurable impressions.\nAverage Cost Per Exposed Qualiﬁed Audience\n- The average cost of advertising for each qualiﬁed digital identiﬁer who was prescribed the brand drug and exposed to the campaign or line item.\nAverage Cost Per TRx\n- The average cost of advertising for each total prescription for the brand drug to a qualiﬁed digital identiﬁer who has been exposed to the campaign or line item.\nAverage Cost Per NRx\n- The average cost of advertising for each new prescription for the brand drug to a qualiﬁed digital identiﬁer who has been exposed to the campaign or line item.\nAverage Cost Per NBRx\n- The average cost of advertising for each new-to-brand prescription for the brand drug to a qualiﬁed digital identiﬁer who has been exposed to the campaign or line item.\n*If there are less than five prescriptions under a prescription type, we will not show cost per metrics for that type of prescription.\nTrend Line Deﬁnitions:\nA comparison of the campaign or line item trends over time.\nTotal Revenue\n- Total cost of advertising\nTRx\n- Count of total prescriptions\nNRx\n- Count of new prescriptions\nNBRx\n- Count of new-to-brand prescriptions\nNew Exposed Qualiﬁed Audience\n- Count of new exposed qualiﬁed visitors with a prescription for the brand drug and a mapped digital identiﬁer.\nDemographics definitions:\n>\nNOTE\n- If there are less than 100 exposed qualified visitors, we will not show this breakdown.\nGeography:\nState -\nCount of exposed qualiﬁed visitors broken down by the State in which they reside.\nMap\n- Count of exposed qualiﬁed visitors broken down by the ZIP Code in which they reside.\nOccupation\n- Count of exposed qualiﬁed visitors broken down by their primary occupation.\nAge\n- Count of exposed qualiﬁed visitors broken down by their age range.\nGender\n- Count of exposed qualiﬁed visitors broken down by their identiﬁed gender.",

Be sure to let our team know if you have any questions regarding the tags that were sent. some clients only Implement one or two tags while others implement many, so checking to ensure that you are placing the correct corresponding tag from the sheet to the designated account or campaign is highly recommended.\nAccount-Level Setup\n:\nNow you are ready to set up your tag or tags!\nStep 1\n:\nlook to the panel on the left-hand side of the user interface.\n-Click on the “Settings” option followed by “Account Settings”\n- Scroll down and click on the “Tracking” dropdown tab.\nStep 2\n:\nCopy your HCP365 Search tag and paste either the SA360 - Google Search pixel\nOR\nthe SA360 - Bing search pixel into the\nfirst\nbox labeled “\nTracking template\n”.\n*IMPORTANT NOTE*  - Combining your HCP365 Pixel with an existing tracking tag.\nIf you already have SA360 tracking set up and have to add your SA360 Google or Bing PulsePoint pixel into the same tracking template, this can be done by adding it onto the end of your existing tracking template and pasting it after the \"\nds_dest_url=\n\" parameter. It is also a good idea to encode our pixel\nto ensure that it remains intact, thereby preventing any potential tracking issues. We tend to see issues if there is more than a single url in a pixel and it does not have wrapping applied.\nBelow is an example of an existing Google SA360 tracking\nbefore\nand\nafter\nadding your PulsePoint Google Search Pixel. The Pulsepoint Pixel should be encoded to ensure that it remains intact, thereby preventing any potential tracking issues.\nEXAMPLE - (Tracking Template)\nBEFORE\n:\nhttps://ad.doubleclick.net/searchads/link/click?{_dssagcrid}&ds_a_cid=123456789&ds_a_caid={campaignid}&ds_a_agid={adgroupid}&ds_a_fiid={feeditemid}&ds_a_lid={targetid}&ds_a_extid={extensionid}&{_dssftfiid}&ds_e_adid={creative}&ds_e_matchtype={ifsearch:search}{ifcontent:content}&ds_e_device={device}&ds_e_network={network}&{ifpla:ds_e_product_group_id={product_partition_id}&ds_e_product_id={product_id}&ds_e_product_merchant_id={merchant_id}&ds_e_product_country={product_country}&ds_e_product_language={product_language}&ds_e_product_channel={product_channel}&ds_e_product_store_id={store_code}}&ds_url_v=2&ds_dest_url={unescapedlpurl}\nEXAMPLE - (Tracking Template + SA360 Pulsepoint Pixel)\nAFTER\n:\nhttps://ad.doubleclick.net/searchads/link/click?{_dssagcrid}&ds_a_cid=123456789&ds_a_caid={campaignid}&ds_a_agid={adgroupid}&ds_a_fiid={feeditemid}&ds_a_lid={targetid}&ds_a_extid={extensionid}&{_dssftfiid}&ds_e_adid={creative}&ds_e_matchtype={ifsearch:search}{ifcontent:content}&ds_e_device={device}&ds_e_network={network}&{ifpla:ds_e_product_group_id={product_partition_id}&ds_e_product_id={product_id}&ds_e_product_merchant_id={merchant_id}&ds_e_product_country={product_country}&ds_e_product_language={product_language}&ds_e_product_channel={product_channel}&ds_e_product_store_id={store_code}}&ds_url_v=2&\nds_dest_url\n=\nhttps%3A%2F%2Fbh.contextweb.com%2Fbh%2Fsr%3Faction%3Dadd%26token%3DPOPYRGQBTNZL%26ch%3D2%26cid%3DPPC-accountype%3A{_dsaccounttype}-campaign%3A{_dscampaign}-searchterm%3A{_dssearchterm}-adgroup%3A{_dsadgroup}-keywordid%3A{_dskeywordid}%26rurl%3D{escapedlpurl+2}%2526us_privacy%253D${us_privacy}\n*We recommend doing the same for your HCP365 Bing tag provided that your are attempting to append to an existing tracking template*\nStep 3:\nDirectly\nbelow the Tracking Template box, you will notice a content box labeled\n“\nFinal URL Suffix.\n” This should only be filled in if:\nYou are implementing a Bing tag and planning on having your UTM parameters passed through the pixel.\nOR\nYou are implementing a Google pixel but you are not using auto-tagging. (In most cases, auto-tagging is being applied in Google Analytics or Google Ads)\nOR\nThere is some other special parameter that you are looking to implement which also happens to be compatible with SA360.\nFeel free to paste the parameter string provided into the \"Final URL Suffix\" content box. If you need to apply UTM parameters as well, both strings can be combined. You can find instructions on how to do that right below.\nApplying UTM Parameters OR Recommended Strings.\nIn SA360, if you are setting up a new\nHCP365 - Goog\nle\nTag and you also plan on populating UTM parameters, you must do one of two things.\n1. Make sure that auto-tagging is enabled in Google Analytics.\nOR\n2. Apply the UTM parameter string manually in the Final URL Suffix box if auto-tagging is not an option.\nIn SA360, if you are setting up a new\nHCP365 - Bin\ng\nTracking Template/ Pixel Tag and you also plan on populating UTM parameters, you can do one thing: Add them to the Final URL Suffix!\nYour UTM Parameters for a Bing tag should be formatted similar to the following example:\nutm_source=bing&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign={_dscampaign}&utm_term={_dssearchterm}\nHowever, we already recommend adding a string to the Final URL Suffix so that our values don't come through our reporting blank. The string we recommend is as follows:\ncid=PPC-accountype:{_dsaccounttype}-campaign:{_dscampaign}-searchterm:{_dssearchterm}-adgroup:{_dsadgroup }-keywordid:{_dskeywordid}\nSo, If UTM parameters are required, they can only be added manually in SA360 for Bing tags, so we recommended combining our custom string with the UTM string. The final string will look like the example below.\ncid=PPC-accountype:{_dsaccounttype}-campaign:{_dscampaign}-searchterm:{_dssearchterm}-adgroup:{_dsadgroup }-keywordid:{_dskeywordid}\n&utm_source=bing&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign={_dscampaign}&utm_term={_dssearchterm}\nStep 4:\nOnce all of this is considered, compile your Final URL Suffix string and click on\nTEST\nStep 5\n:\nClick Save\nCampaign-level Setup:\nIf you have all HCP, DTC, and/or UNB campaigns falling under the same account, your HCP365 Search pixels will have to be implemented separately on the campaign level so that they can be tracked under the correct HCP365 collection.\nIf that is the case, please follow the setup below:\nStep 1:\nLook to the left-hand panel and click “Campaigns”\nStep 2:\nClick into your designated campaign and look once again to the left-hand panel and\nclick “Settings” then click “Campaign Settings” - This will reveal a menu with panels.\nStep 3:\nClick on “Additional Settings” - this will create another drop-down. Next, click\non the “Campaign URL Options” tab. This will reveal two boxes:\nTracking Template\nand\nFinal URL Suffix.\nJust like the copy & paste instructions for\nStep 2\nunder “\nAccount-Level Setup”\n, the pixel can be implemented the same way. The only difference is that you will have to implement different pixels to match the campaign’s audience segment.\nAfter pasting your HCP365 Search pixel into the Tracking Template, make sure auto-tagging is enabled. If you desire to have UTM parameters applied to your campaign, you have to\nOnce tracking has been entered, Click “Test” to make sure that your tag is functioning properly, then click “SAVE.”\nSA360 - Google / Bing Tracking Implementation\nThe same steps 1-5 li\nsted above can be applied when implementing your\nGoogle - Bing (SA360)\nPixel for tracking in SA360. Below is a brief description broken in a few steps. You can pretty much follow the instructions above if you are looking to implement on the Account level or the Campaign level.\nStep 1:\nClick on\nCopy/paste the\nG\noogle - Bing (SA360)\nscript provided by your Account Manager in\nto the “Tracking Template box\n.\nDo not include the Optional Parameters. It should look something like this:\nhttps://bh.contextweb.com/bh/sr?action=add&token=CTKQXQ18H6UB&ch=2&rurl={lpurl}&us_privacy=${us_privacy}&gpp=${GPP_STRING_XXXXX}&gpp_sid=${GPP_SID\n}\nStep 2:\nApply your UTM parameters into the Final URL Suffix box located directly below the Tracking Template. The additional parameters which are included in the pixel are optional.\n*IMPORTANT NOTE*\nIf you already have SA360 tracking set up and want to add your\nSA360-Bing\npixel into the same tracking template, this can be done by adding it onto the end of your existing tracking template and pasting it after the \"\nds_dest_url=\n\" parameter. It is also a good idea to encode our pixel\nto ensure that it remains intact, thereby preventing any potential tracking issues.\nBelow is an example of existing SA360 tracking\nbefore\nand\nafter\nadding your PulsePoint SA360-Bing Search Pixel. The Pulsepoint Pixel should be encoded to ensure that it remains intact, thereby preventing any potential tracking issues.\nEXAMPLE - (Tracking Template)\nBEFORE\n:\nhttps://ad.doubleclick.net/searchads/link/click?{_dssagcrid}&{_dssadxid}&ds_e_adid={AdId}&ds_e_target_id={TargetId}&{ifpla:ds_e_product_group_id={CriterionId}&ds_e_product_id={ProductId}&ds_e_product_country={product_country}&ds_e_product_language={product_language}&ds_e_product_channel={product_channel}}&ds_e_network={network}&ds_url_v=2&ds_dest_url=\nEXAMPLE - (Tracking Template + SA360-Bing)\nAFTER\n:\nhttps://ad.doubleclick.net/searchads/link/click?{_dssagcrid}&{_dssadxid}&ds_e_adid={AdId}&ds_e_target_id={TargetId}&{ifpla:ds_e_product_group_id={CriterionId}&ds_e_product_id={ProductId}&ds_e_product_country={product_country}&ds_e_product_language={product_language}&ds_e_product_channel={product_channel}}&ds_e_network={network}&ds_url_v=2\n&ds_dest_url=\nhttps%3A%2F%2Fbh.contextweb.com%2Fbh%2Fsr%3Faction%3Dadd%26token%3D\nCTKQXQ18H6UB\n%26ch%3D2%26rurl%3D{lpurl+2}%26us_privacy%3D${us_privacy}\nFor the Final URL Suffix, we recommend that you implement the followingenside\nAvailable Macros:\nImplementing Your HCP365 Bing Pixel in Microsoft Ads Platform\nIn a scenario where you have a standalone setup in Microsoft Ads and you are not utilizing SA360, our team can provide you with a Bing pixel specifically designed to operate within that platform.\nJust like with SA360, your pixel can be implemented on the\nAccount Level\nor the\nCampaign Level.\nTo implement your Bing pixel, please adhere to the following Instructions:\nAccount-level Setup:\nStep 1:\nGo to the Microsoft Advertising website and log in to your account.\nStep 2\n:\nFrom the navigation menu on the left, Click on the\nCampaigns\nicon and select Settings > Account level options.\nStep 3:\nAt the bottom of the list, select Settings > Account level options.\nStep 4:\nPaste your Bing pixel script provided to you by your account manager into the “\nTracking\nTemplate”\nbox.

      "content": "Introduction\nAdaptive Optimization\nTM\n(AO) is PulsePoint’s AI-powered bidding technology that leverages our premium data foundation to identify and prioritize the most relevant consumers and clinicians. By continually re-scoring audience cohorts and dynamically adjusting budgets, AO helps brands reach more qualified audiences, boost campaign performance, and maximize impact while respecting privacy and compliance standards.\nAdaptive Optimization does not change your audience targeting. Instead, it applies PulsePoint’s high-value clinical and digital data to optimize bids in real time. By scoring and prioritizing audience cohorts based on clinical relevance and health behaviors,\nwithout altering your target audience\n, it focuses your budget on the people most likely to engage. AO reduces wasted spend, improves campaign efficiency, and respects privacy.\nNOTES\nAdaptive Optimization is not supported if you have selected any of these\nMedia Optimizations\n:\nFlat\nReach (Tactic, Line Item, Campaign)\nAdaptive Optimizations may incur an additional data cost CPM.\nPackages and Factors\nAdaptive Optimization offers various\npackages\n, which are curated models.
